Based on DynAPI-3.0.0-beta1, exercises with drag-and-drop interfaces can now be designed in a very easy way. The best way to use them is thru the OEF syntax. Although the scripts are accessible to WIMS modules, the API protocol is rather complicated and undocumented for direct use in a module.

For examples of drag-and-drop exercises, you can take a look at the modules OEF clock, Arithmetic tables and Order arrangement.</pre>
