Are you interested in writing your own activities to be hosted by 
WIMS? If you have tried
&lt;a target=wims_demo
href=wims.cgi?module=adm/createxo>Createxo&lt;/a> and are unsatisfied
by the power of the exercises it allows you to create, you can now
take a look at
&lt;a target=wims_demo
href=wims.cgi?module=adm/modtool>Modtool&lt;/a> which makes it possible
to create and develop full-power WIMS modules by working entirely
online.

For obvious security reasons, you must first write to the site manager
asking him/her to attribute a developer authentification (login, password)
to you, before you can access Modtool.

Please also note that WIMS modules are written in a special (interpreted)
language. You should probably consult the
&lt;a target=wims_help href=wims.cgi?module=help/wimsdoc.en>WIMS Technical
Documentation&lt;/a> for the format and syntax of a module if you
want to write one.</pre>
