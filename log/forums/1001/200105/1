Please take care of the following points if you install WIMS on 
recent Linux distributions such as RedHat 7.

Due to software license problems, the popular graphics format GIF is
now no longer well-supported in these distributions. However, the replacement
formats (png, jpeg) trigger many bugs in related softwares (ImageMagic,
Gnuplot, Povray, etc.) on which WIMS depend heavily.

So if you install WIMS on these recent distributions, you can either
use these replacement formats (png or jpeg) by changing the corresponding
definitions in the configuration file wims.conf, or follow instructions 
in the README filr of WIMS to recompile some packages (gnuplot and
ImageMagic) in order to keep using GIF.</pre>
