WIMS uses TeX to render mathematical symbols and formulas, and in a dynamic way:

Each time WIMS encounters a formula to be rendered beautifully, it translates the formula into TeX input, calls TeX to translate it into a .dvi file, then translate the latter into a graphics file (gif).

Up to now, the last step uses dvips to translate the dvi file into postscript image, then calls ImageMagick to translate the image into a browser-recognized graphics format. ImageMagick calls in turn Ghostscript to interpret the postscript file. All these steps take a huge amount of time, sensibly slowing down the server, create many compatibility problems, and the result is not always satisfactory.

Now, a direct dvi to gif driver program is incorporated into WIMS, that directly translates dvi into a gif file. You should immediately feel the speed up of the server when several formulas are rendered in the page. And compatibility problems should no longer exist.

Moreover, this driver is ready to take more features, such as colored fonts in TeX formulas. It can also be used as a standalone program, outside WIMS. However, documentation for this purpose is not written yet.

On the other hand, you should also remark the difference in the appearances of the fonts. They are now sharper, but anti-aliasing is gone. This is because current version does not make size-reduction. In fact, whether anti-aliasing is better is quite subject to individual appreciation. Therefore, even if size-reduction and anti-aliasing is very easy to add to the driver, these will not take place unless there is a strong preference from the users' side. So write me if you want them!</pre>
