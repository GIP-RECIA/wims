<pre>
From this version (3.10) up, WIMS front page reorganization is 
(almost) completed
with uniformized searching facility and browsing facility.
&lt;p>
You can now 
&lt;a href=wims.cgi?module=adm/browse>browse the site&lt;/a>
by type, by subject, or by level. This browsing facility being coupled
by the search engine, you may modify the search command after a browsing
command.
&lt;p>
It remains to add a Chinese language adaptor to the search engine.
&lt;p>
In virtual classes, a structure of examination sheets has been added
and tested. More class management facilities are added, such as
restricting score registration by date and time.
&lt;p>
There has also been a bug correction of the TeX insertion image generation
mechanism. The bug made some recent browsers (Konqueror, Mozilla) unable
to display correctly the image files. In order for this bug correction
to take full effect, you should clean the directory

$wims_home/public_html/instex/

(erase all subdirectories), after installing the new version.</pre>
