This version brings about an important acceleration of the server, due to
the rewriting of some kernel codes. However, it was not that slow, so the
benefit of this acceleration is felt mainly when there are a big number of
simultaneous connections (more than a few dozens).
&lt;p>
Here are the results of some tests run on a 1GHz Athlon station.

&lt;tr>&lt;td>Dynamic TeX formula&lt;td>90 ms&lt;td>55 ms
&lt;tr>&lt;td>Multiple calls to PARI/GP&lt;br>(starting from the second call)
&lt;td>65 ms&lt;td>3 ms

&lt;tr>&lt;td>Write a variable&lt;td>20 \(mu)s&lt;td>2 \(mu)s
&lt;/table>&lt;/center>
&lt;p>
There are still potentials of performance improvement, especially on
the dynamic generation of graphics and animations. These will be realised in
a future version.
&lt;p>
For a preliminary estimation, a WIMS server of the new version run on a
recent PC with sufficient memory (256MB or up) will be able to serve up to
a few hundreds of simultaneous connections, as long as there is no intensive
use of dynamic animations.
&lt;p>
This version also features the beginning of the use of site configuration.
And the package is reported to work on Mac OS-X.
