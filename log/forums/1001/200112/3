Starting from WIMS version 3.10, new features are added into its OEF (open exercise format) manager. Including:&lt;ol>

&lt;li>The possibility of inserting mathematical symbols and formulas into statements (under html format), hints and solutions, with the same automatic formula formatting feature as in the WIMS forums.

&lt;li>When many exercises are available under one module, the introduction page will allow you to select exercises containing a certain word. To facilitate your search for the desired one.

&lt;li>A \feedback directive is added to the syntax, allowing you to write (warning) messages to students who give answers revealing a typical error. (Thanks to a suggestion of Jan Hlavacek.)

&lt;li>Exercises with no reply (nor multiple choice) can be created. This is in preparation for a new feature under which virtual class participants may compose an answer, to be sent to the teacher for correction. (exercises with human-analyzed replies)

&lt;li>On the other hand, the planned possibility of embedding reply fields into statements will not (yet) be available under this version. There are still some technical questions on this, that I don't have a satisfactory answer.

&lt;/ol>

Enjoy!</pre>
