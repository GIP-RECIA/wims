Starting from version 3.10, WIMS includes a utility allowing site
managers to do major site maintenance tasks directly online. So now you may become WIMS site manager without knowledge on Linux.
&lt;p>
In this version, this tool only allows you to do basic tasks: configuration, support software checkup, security verification, documents, etc. But this tool is planned to let you do everything you will need for the maintenance, totally freeing you from the necessity of logging to the wims account.
&lt;p>
In using it, you (as site manager) must be aware that if you let others have access to this tool, your site will be exposed to the risk of being totally ruined. So you must define the authentification of the tool (password, sites) very carefully, and choose a setup as restrictive as possible.
&lt;p>
By default (in the distribution), this tool is set to be open only to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). When you connect from localhost, the server will check to see whether your connection is from the wims account. If so, you will be allowed to use the maintenance tool without being asked for a password (you will see a link in the wims home page). That will allow you to redefine the access parameters to this tool, for example by adding more accessing hosts (once again, be careful!), or by requiring https access (if you have one).
&lt;p>
In any case, you don't need to define a permanent password for the tool. The server can generate one-time passwords each time you want to connect. Just follow instructions on the page.</pre>
