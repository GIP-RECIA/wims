Recent addition to syntaxes of WIMS documents and OEF exercises:&lt;ol>

&lt;li>A new data type, &lt;tt>matrix&lt;/tt>, which can not only be processed as a matrix (mathematical object), but also and especially can be used as a very simple relational database, each row of the matrix being one entry of the database. Functions are created for extracting entries (&lt;tt>row(), rows(), randomrow()&lt;/tt>) or columns (&lt;tt>column&lt;/tt>), or for conditional selection (&lt;tt>row()&lt;/tt>).

&lt;li>All processing functions are now available in the testing conditions of &lt;tt>\\condition&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>\\feedback&lt;/tt> of OEF.

&lt;li>Dynamic drawing now accepts animations.

&lt;li>Readers of a document can send parameters to the document being read. Commands have been created (&lt;tt>\\form&lt;/tt>) or enhanced (&lt;tt>\\link&lt;/tt>) in order to facilitate parameter passing.

&lt;li>Jumping/looping commands in documents: &lt;tt>\\if&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>\\for&lt;/tt>. Now documents are fully programmable.


&lt;/ol>

Details about these new features can be found in the help pages of the related online development tools.</pre>
