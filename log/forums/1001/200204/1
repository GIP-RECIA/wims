OEF exercises (that is, those that you can write using
&lt;a href=wims.cgi?module=adm/createxo>Createxo&lt;/a>) accept freestyle replies that can be analyzed/compared as various types of objects.

For mathematical expressions, the available types are literal expression, algebraic expression, formal expression, numerical expression, in descending order of rigour of comparison. As a literal expression, even 1+1 and 2 are not mixed up. While as a formal expression, one can freely exchange \(2/(x^2-1)) and \(1/(x-1)-1/(x+1)), and as a numerical expression, \(sqrt(2)) and 1.41421 make no difference.

For text inputs, there are also case-sensitive text, case-nonsensitive text, approximative text, words in a list, in descending order of rigour. In the first one, only repetitions of spaces are ignored. For approximative text, differences in upper/lower case, singular/plural, and even articles are ignored. And for words in a list, word orders are ignored too. Furthermore, in all these cases, synonymes can be defined.

And there are also special types for mathematical objects that have been there for quite some time: numbers with units, matrix, finite set, etc.

In a freestyle input, what if the student makes a simple typing error?

Don't worry, for the server can often detect typing errors. Such errors will not be considered as a wrong reply, and the student will be given opportunity to correct them.

Such ``correctable'' errors range from wrong variable names in mathematical expressions, wrong expression forms in mathematical expressions with high rigour, missing unit in number with units,
to unrecognized words in text input.

Details of all these are explained in the help pages of the online OEF development tool (Createxo).</pre>
