Some of new features in version 3.30&#58;

1. Incompatibilities with newer Linux distributions are fixed.

2. WIMS now comes with an autonomous http server&#58; wimsd. It is for the time being a bit preliminary, with a frontend accepting only localhost connections. But it can easily be scripted for use as a system daemon. This http server is very light and very clean, but it does not work with https.

3. Printable versions of some important helps.

4. Several new commands have been added to the command language (&#33;sum, &#33;product, &#33;recursion, &#33;reaccent, &#33;lookup).

5. Enhancements to the OEF manager.

6. Additions to slib.
