There are several additions and changes since 2.32:&lt;ol>
&lt;p>&lt;li>A structure of examination sheets in virtual classes, allowing
teachers to setup exams with limited duration and random pickup of
exercises. More details in the related help pages within
virtual classes.
&lt;p>&lt;li>A beginning Italian version (server + 2 modules), thanks to
&lt;a href=mailto:marina@matapp.unimib.it>Marina Cazzola&lt;/a>.
&lt;p>&lt;li>Many new exercises, especially 
a series of algebra and geometry exercises by Clemence Knaebel.
&lt;p>&lt;li>Various bug fixes and technical modifications.
&lt;/ol></pre>
