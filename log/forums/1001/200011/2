This is an intermediate version whose principal aim is to reflect
the change of source location. WIMS source download now uses http, at
&lt;a href=http://wims.unice.fr/download/wims>http://wims.unice.fr/download/wims&lt;/a>,
because the ftp server at wims.unice.fr is closed by the
local firewall for security reasons.

Besides, we have added a new recreation piece,
&lt;a href=wims.cgi?module=H5/geometry/pathfind>Pathfind&lt;/a>.</pre>
