Here are the main feature enhancements in version 3.18.
&lt;ol>

&lt;li>For OEF exercises: freehand replies and multiple choices can now have mixed orders or be directly embedded in statements. Multi-step exercises can be designed, and conditional branching as well as loops can be added to the source, via &lt;tt>\if&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>\for&lt;/tt>.

&lt;li>For virtual classes: participants can compare his/her score with class min/average/max. The teacher can now wrote document blocks and use them to replace some presentation pages of the class (participant home page and work sheet pages). Exercise dependencies are also added: the teacher can require participants to succeed in certain exercises before he/she can do other, depending, exercises.

&lt;li>For documents: LaTeX sources can be sent by the author, to be automatically translated to WIMS document format. (Based on Latex2html).

&lt;li>For the kernel: compilation can now be done with either dynamic or static linking to wims library.

&lt;/ol></pre>
