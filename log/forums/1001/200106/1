Starting version 2.44 (testing version), WIMS adopts a simplified
home page incorporating
a uniformized search engine for every type of resources hosted by the
server: modules, popup calculators, web addresses, work sheets, etc.

This search engine is part of WIMS system. As a consequence, 
Postgresql (or any other sql engine) is no longer needed. Compared with
the sql search, the new search presents several advantages:
&lt;ol>

&lt;li>Performance. As it works much faster than sql-based searches, the
server is more responsive, and the searches affect much less the
server load level.

&lt;li>Intelligence. It can recognize synonymes (for example if you search
for the word "integration", then resources containing "integral" or
"integrals" will also be shown), accepts natural language inputs ("How to 
plot a curve"), presents the results sorted according to their levels
of relevency, etc.

&lt;li>Convenience. You can switch from one kind of search to another
without retyping.

&lt;/ol>

On the other hand, the complete list of modules can no longer be shown 
on the home page. There are now simply too many avaiable modules, so
that the complete list does not make much sense. On the contrary, an empty
search on a category of modules gives the list of (10) most popular
modules of this category, sorted according to the measure of
popularity. This should be much more pertinent than the complete list.</pre>
