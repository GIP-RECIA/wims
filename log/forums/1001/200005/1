Starting from version 2.30, message boards are available under WIMS.

Besides conventional features allowing you to navigate through
messages in the message boards, there is a very convenient way allowing
you to include mathematical formulas into your messages.
When the reader sees your message, they will see the formulas 
automatically formatted as they should be.

For example, you can just write &lt;tt>\\pi&lt;/tt> for \pi,
&lt;tt>\\le&lt;/tt> for \le,
&lt;tt>\\ne&lt;/tt> for \ne, &lt;tt>\\rightarrow&lt;/tt> for \rightarrow, etc.
While for more complex formulas, you have 
\(sqrt(1/x+1/y)) through &lt;tt>\\(sqrt(1/x+1/y))&lt;/tt>,
 integrals \(int(e^(1-x^2))dx) through
&lt;tt>\\(int(e^(1-x^2))dx)&lt;/tt>, or even matrices
\([1,2,3;4,5,6]) through &lt;tt>\\([1,2,3;4,5,6])&lt;/tt>.

And if you know TeX, very complex formulas can be constructed by
entering TeX sources. See the help link at the top of this page for
more details.

Every virtual class automatically contains a message board allowing
teacher and students to communicate between them.

For the time being, there is yet no facility allowing you to create
your message board directly online. If you want to create a message board
right now to use the above features (outside a virtual class environment),
you may write to the site manager asking him/her to create it for you.
(This situation is temporary; check new announcements in this forum
for future upgrades.)</pre>
