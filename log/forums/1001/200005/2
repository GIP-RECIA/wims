Main changes in this version (wrt 2.23):&lt;ol>

&lt;li>A more secure setup when spawning programs: risky programs are 
now spawned with a different uid which prohibits them from
reading/writing to sensitive Wims directories.

Also the dual-uid trouble with gnuplot and TeX is now completely solved.
This allows site managers to close the session and log directories to
other than user wims itself. (Usually Wims distribution has these
directory attributes set to 700, but if you have changed them to more
open due to the above dual-uid trouble, you should now change them back.)

&lt;li>OEF (Online Exercise Format) now accepts several types of freestyle
answers: formal math, set, vector, matrix, physical quantity (thanks to
units-filter by Georges Khaznadar). All of them are functional but 
set, vector and matrix cannot be efficiently used because there is no
directives to manipulate these objects.

&lt;li>Added message boards (see previous message).

&lt;li>A drawing program, flydraw, which is downward compatible with fly
but much more powerful (linewidth, plot, color by names, scaling, etc.), 
replaces fly. This program can be used stand-alone in non-wims
environment, but I will make no effort to distribute it other than
as a component of Wims.

The ultimate aim is an online utility allowing users to draw pictures
using quasi-natural languages.

&lt;li>Administration modules for virtual class management have been 
relocated. Please report any eventual anomalies resulting from this 
change.

&lt;/ol>

This new version is available as usual from
&lt;a href=ftp://wims.unice.fr/pub/wims/>ftp://wims.unice.fr/pub/wims/&lt;/a>.
