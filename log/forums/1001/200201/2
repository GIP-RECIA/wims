<pre>
WIMS version 3.10 is now available. From this version up, ready-to-install rpm packages are also available (i386-Linux only), both for WIMS and for support softwares.

Using rpm packages greatly simplifies the installation. All you have to do is to download the packages (you may just download them all), and run the script 'installrpm.sh'. For more details, you may also wish to read the README-rpm file.

These packages have been reported to work with RedHat 7.0-7.2, and will probably also work with other recent Linux versions that accept rpm packages.

The only thing to remark for people updating from older versions is that if you install rpm packages, your WIMS home directory will be displaced (to /var/wims/). Existing resources (classes, forums, exercises) will be copied to the new location, but the old installation will be left intact and has to be erased manually (once you are sure that the new is working correctly).</pre>
