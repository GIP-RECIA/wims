<pre>
It is now possible to include 2D drawings into the statement of OEF exercises
(under html format) as well as documents. These drawings are dynamic, that is, you can use variables in your draw commands, and the result will vary with the values of the variables.

The syntax of the commands is available in the help pages of the corresponding managing tools. This is a very rough syntax, and our objective is to extend it to something close to natural language.

For the time being, this capability is not available for message boards. The principle reason is that it is not clear whether this is really needed.</pre>
