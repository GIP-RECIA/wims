Main changes in this version:

1. Grades computation in virtual classes are simplified, and
supervisors can manually enter grades for participants (obtained
elsewhere), which will be taken into account in the global average.

2. Online creation of message boards.

3. Compatibility with Debian Linux (tested for 2.1) and LinuxPPC.

4. Module log is now disabled by default (improves performance).
See the file wims.conf.template for how to enable it.</pre>
