There is an important performance bug in WIMS-3.20:

Since 3.20, the spawning of child processes makes use of non-blocking waiting loop to keep runaway processes in check. This loop consumes quite a lot of CPU time (the parent process is always running whatever the child is doing), and slows down the response time.

This bug will be fixed in the next (bugfix) release due out in a few days, with the waiting loop replaced by an alarm based on the signal SIGALRM.</pre>
