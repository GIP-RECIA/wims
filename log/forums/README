How to set up privileged message boards (that is, those which allow 
anonymous visitors read/post messages):

1. Everything is located in $wims_home/forums (that is, this directory).

2. Set up a (unprivileged) message board from the online creation tool.

3. In this directory, locate the new message board whose directory name
should be a number greater than 11111.

4. Rename this message board directory to a number between 2000 and 9999.

5. Run the script .build-index.

6. Connect to the message board as owner, thru the web. And reconfigure 
the message board to allow visitors to read/post as you like. Be aware of
abuses if you allow anybody to post!
