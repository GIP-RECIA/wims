Three series of exercises at different levels (junior high school, high
school and university) are presented as an example here.
The exercises in each worksheet intend to give you an idea of the kind
of exercises that can easily be made with Quicktool.
<p>
For the exercises to work  please use Mozilla
Firefox as your browser (tested with version 2.0.0.4). If you are using
Internet explorer some of the exercises may bug.
