Insert popup tool forms of WIMS. Variable number of arguments.

Each argument must be the exact address of a form. (To find the address of forms, make a search of such forms in the home page of WIMS.
Then the address of each form can be found in the source of the returned page.)

For example,
<span class="tt wims_code_words">\\calcform{calcu/int,alg/factor}</span> gives the following result.

\calcform{calcu/int,alg/factor}
