Your document can be composed block by block, entirely online.

Documents outside a virtual class are protected by secret codes. You should enter the secret code in order to enter editing mode of the document.

In this case, each page contains buttons 
<span class="tt wims_code_words">[Editer]</span>.
Clicking on it, you will have a page (in your browser) with a text window allowing to type the content of the corresponding block. You may also copy a prepared text (or part of an existing web page) into the text window, then register it.

The content of the document is in <em>html</em> format, with additioinal \link{syntax}{special commands} and \link{def}{variable processings}.

You can freely add links into your pages (blocks) pointing to elements at the external of the WIMS server (images, applets, sound, video). On the other hand, for links towards other blocks of the document, you must use the \link{structure}{WIMS method} instead of a direct html link.

Planned for the future: you may deposit elements of the document (images, sound, applets) into the server via email. You may also deposit your existing web pages (or even a complete web site) by giving its web address, and the site will be automatically translated to a WIMS document (under certain conditions). It will also be possible to export a WIMS document towards a traditional web site (but of course certain WIMS functionalities will be lost).
