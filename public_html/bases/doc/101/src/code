This chapter explains the access right of documents outside a virtual class. For documents within virtual classes, please consult \link{classdoc}{this page}.

The access right (read and write) of a document is controlled both by its author and by the site manager.

Each document created contains a author's name and a secret code. The secret code is defined (and can be modified) by the author. It gives right to reading and writing the document.

The author of the document can also determine (and modify at any time) the access right for reading without secret code. But in order that a document be readable by the public, the site manager must also give his agreement.

For the general public, only documents made accessible by both the author and the site manager will be visible. For other documents, authors must first give their names to see the list of documents belonging to them, then type the secret code of a document in order to modify it.

Thus, an author may give the right to modify a document to several persons, by communicating the secret code to them. It may even allow all those knowing his name to modify his document, by putting the secret code into the title of the document.
