Administratively, students are divided into around 11 groups, one group having up to 40 students.

One virtual class is created for each student group. The teacher responsible of teaching the WIMS course to this group becomes the supervisor of the virtual class.

In the virtual class, one worksheet is setup for each week's assignment. Within the 11 groups, 8 have one 90-minute session per week, and 3 have two sessions. Therefore, the worksheet for the latter is longer than that for the former.

Some of the worksheets set up during year 2000-2001 are publicly accessible on the server, with equivalance translations into English. To see them, just make a search for the words 'unsa 2001' for worksheets in WIMS home page. (Those with MP in their titles are for two sessions, and those with MI are for one session.)

In order to avoid repetition in workload setting up worksheets, virtual classes corresponding to groups with the same workload are sharing the worksheet space.

Each worksheet is activated several days before the computer-room sessions. This allows students to practice on the worksheet before the session, however scores can only be registered during the session, and from the designated computer rooms.

Score severity level of worksheets are set to 2 or 3, and may vary from group to group. The teacher of the group also decides on the weight of each sheet for his/her group, taking into account how the sheets are worked on for the group.

In one occasion, all the virtual classes are set to using a unique supervisor password. This is very convenient when mutual replacements of teachers take place. This has been abandonned after an incident in which a leak of the password lead to vandalisms to several classes.
