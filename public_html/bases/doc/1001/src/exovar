We make more and more uses of computer-generated exercises, ranging from simple Multiple Choice Quizzes (MCQ) to sophisticated step-by-step activities.

Such an exercise may be static, that is, it is a unique question with a unique appearance (and often a unique good solution). But they may also be dynamic, that is, they may contain ramdon parameters that change their look (statement and answer) at each new request.

We call the latter <em>exercises with variations</em>. They have many advantages over exercises with no variations, but the basic point is that a reliable scoring system can only be based on exercises with variations. On the other hand, special considerations should be taken into the design of an exercise with variations.

WIMS support variations for all kinds of exercises on it, and WIMS tools for online exercise creation, such as \tool{module=adm/createxo}, can be used for writing exercises with variations.
