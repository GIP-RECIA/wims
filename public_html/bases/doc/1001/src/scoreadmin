Students will take WIMS scores seriously only if they are their <em>real</em> scores, that is, only if you (the teacher) use them administratively.

And scores can be used administratively only if they reliably reflect the degree of understanding of their owners (students). This means that as a teacher, you must make sure that the scores of each student are obtained by understanding and solving exercises himself/herself.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that many students will have a strong temptation of obtaining good scores without working hard (call it cheating if you want). If any of such attempts is known to succeed, honest students will feel injustice and protest, and the administrative use of the scores will become impossible.

In the following, we list the most common such attempts, as well as how to check them.<ol>

<li>The very first attempt will be to copy his/her neighbor.

<li>A student may also ask somebody else to work and get scores at his/her place.
\fold{presencemust}{<!-->}

<li>Or (s)he may communicate exercises to others and receive solutions.
\fold{anticomm}{<!-->}

<li>Facing exercices with variations, some students will naturally try to repeatedly ask for the same exercise, until they obtain an easier (or known) version.
\fold{antirepeat}{<!-->}

<li>Some may peek into the source of the exercise page, trying to find out a written solution.
\fold{peeksource}{<!-->}

<li>Some may try to send fake answers by manually typing a request to server, telling it that (s)he has made a good answer, while not giving the answer.
\fold{manualtyping}{<!-->}

<li>A more radical temptation is to steal the supervisor's password, log in as such and change his/her scores.
\fold{passprotect}{<!-->}

<li>If there is a very ``<em>computer-oriented</em>'' student in your class, he/she may even try to break into the server.
