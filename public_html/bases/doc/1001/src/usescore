WIMS can be used in teaching in different ways and at different depths. From very light use (you simply recommend some tool or exercise to your students), to intermediate (you bring your students to a computer room, and tell them to practice on a designated exercise), to heavy (you set up a virtual class, register your students, and assign works in worksheets).

Although such introduction of WIMS in your teaching may already be very interesting, it remains superficial until you make serious use of it: activate student scores, and make the pledge to your students that these scores will be taken seriously (that is, administratively).

In fact, the real power of WIMS will only be shown when scores are seriously activated. It is at this stage that radical changes in student behavior will take place, as shown by 
\link{experience}{our experiences}. Students become much more active and spontaneous in this case. We may try to
\link{scorewhy}{understand the reasons} behind these changes of behavior.

Care must be taken to \link{scoreadmin}{avoid cheating} when you seriously activate scores, in order to make them as credible as possible.
