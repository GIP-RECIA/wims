To insert a random text, the most common method is to put all the candidate text strings into a comma-separated list, and randomly pick up an item in the list.

This implies that your random text cannot contain embedded comma. If you want a random text that may contain comma, you can use text codes. For example, under html format, the string <tt>&amp;#44;</tt> gives comma.
