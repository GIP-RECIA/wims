A web page of the course is created outside the server, in a place easily accessible by students. In this web page, links are provided guiding students directly to (the authentification page of) individual virtual classes.

The teaching team is composed of 6 to 8 teachers, ranging from graduate students to professors. A teacher usually takes in charge one or two groups.

Each group has one or two 90-minute work sessions in computer rooms (8 groups with 1 work session, and 3 with 2 sessions). A work session takes place in two communicating computer rooms, each having 20 workstations all connected to the Internet.

At the beginning of the first work session, the teacher writes down (on the whiteboard of the computer rooms) the address of the course page as well as the password for registration into the virtual class, and gives a few words of supplementary instructions. In general, after 10 to 15 minutes, a majority of students will get registered into the class and have started to work on the first worksheet.

During subsequent work sessions, the main task of the teacher is to individually answer questions raised by students having difficulty. It turns out that a general lecture on the whiteboard is neither necessary nor welcome by the students, simply because many of them have already mastered the subject during practices before the session. They just need an environment allowing them to concentrate on their work of getting a maximum of scores.

The teacher is also quite busy at the beginning of the second work session, recovering accounts for students having forgotten their passwords.

At the end of the semester, each teacher make adjustments to the severity and weight of worksheets in his/her virtual class, and print out the average scores of the students. Some manual adjustments are made to the printouts (compensation of absences with good reasons, transfers of students, students with multiple accounts, etc.) before the scores are transfered to the administration for computation of student credits.
