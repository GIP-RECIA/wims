There may be several reasons that explain the activeness and spontaneity of students working under WIMS.
<p>
First of all, we cannot deny that for a majority of the students, the most important thing is their grades. The real-time scoring system of WIMS gives students a strong impression that they can control their progress and grades. Many students are working hard to get as many online points as possible.

The importance of online real scores is also shown by another experience in our university, under which a virtual class is created and worksheets installed, in relation with a conventional math course for first-year students. Although we clearly announced to students that the final exam will incorporate (at least 50%) exercises directly printed out from online worksheets, much fewer activities have been seen on this class than those with activated scores.

Secondly, the instantaneous feedback (analysis of the reply and score) also gives a flavor of game to the exercises, with students ``playing'' against the server.

There are also the availability and user-friendliness of the online math tools that help a lot, allowing students to concentrate on the conceptual part of the exercises.
