WIMS allows \link{security}{secured} execution of many different softwares via its web interface.

Various computational tools on WIMS allow the user to access the computing power of the backend softwares in a very user-friendly way, without the need to learn the softwares' command syntaxes. Several softwares may even to chain-executed to increase the power of the tools.

These softwares can also be used to generate \link{exercises}{exercises} with sophisticated random variations,
and/or to analyze replies to these exercises, putting a high level of intelligence into them.

Even online documents and forum messages can make use of these softwares to embed computations into them.

A large number of the best open-source mathematics softwares are currently available behind WIMS, including PARI/GP, Maxima, GAP, Macaulay 2, Octave, gnuplot, Povray, etc.
