Mathematical symbols and formulas can be rendered using very tolerant syntaxes: pratically any unambiguously recognizable formula can be rendered correctly. Whether in programmed exercises and tools, or in online-written documents and forum messages, it suffices to write, for example, <tt>&#92;(pi(x+y)/(x^2+y^2))</tt> in order to get
\(pi(x+y)/(x^2+y^2)). Or <tt>&#92;([1,2,3;4,5,6])</tt> for
\([1,2,3;4,5,6]), or <tt>&#92;(integrate(sin^2(2pix))dx)</tt>
for \(integrate(sin^2(2pix))dx).

These intelligent renderings are generated on the fly, so that any formula can change according to user input, or to the random variation of the context.

The same is true for graphics: besides the fact that dynamic graphics are omnipresent in WIMS-hosted activities, randomly varying drawings, plottings and animations can be inserted into documents and forum messages.

For example,
<a href="https://wims.univ-cotedazur.fr/~xiao/gallery/">this gallery</a> of animated algebraic surfaces is entirely created using the WIMS tool \tool{module=tool/geometry/polyray}.
