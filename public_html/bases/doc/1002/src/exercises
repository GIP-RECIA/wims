Exercises on WIMS are much more powerful than their counterparts found on most other systems.

Instead of limiting user replies to multiple choices, WIMS can accept various types of inputs, including freestyle input that it is able to recognize as a number, a function, a matrix, a sentence, etc. Moreover, no syntax requirement is necessary in these inputs, so that any reasonably recognizable input is correctly recognized. And distinctions can be made between typing errors and a wrong answer. These answers can be analyzed using various \link{softwares}{computing softwares} instead of compared with a standard answer. Multi-step interactions can also be built into these exercises.

The most important feature of WIMS exercises is their capability of random variations. They are generally always dynamic, that is, at each new request, a new exercise is generated and presented. Sophisticated softwares can be used to generate such variations.

Exercises with random variations are very important in that they can support multiple repetitions by users (students), thus helping the comprehension. Combined with solid anti-cheating mechanisms, they provide also a means for a highly reliable and entirely automatic evaluation system using \link{classes}{virtual classe}, under which one can even publish the content of an examination BEFORE the latter takes place.
