             wims error message file, English version.

Environment variable substitutions are valid (variable names start by `$').

A line starting with ':' at the FIRST column is a tag line. Text following
this line will be printed if the tag equals error type; tag line with empty
tag is valid for all error types.

Nothing before the first tag line will be printed; so put comments simply
at the beginning of the file (or after a fictive tag).
