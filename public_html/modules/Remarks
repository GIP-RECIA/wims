The random() of PARI/GP uses linear congruence! It is not sufficiently random.
So if you use this for generation of invertible matrices by (repeated) test
of rank, it may run into an infinite loop. The random function of the system
kernel has no such problem.

Now it is better to use slib scripts to do things like generation of random
invertible matrices.
