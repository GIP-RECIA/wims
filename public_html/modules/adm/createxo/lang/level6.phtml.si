!set name_how_to_hide_help = <h2>Hiding Images files names</h2>\

    <pre>\img{\imagedir/picture.jpg alt="$name_img_accessibility_alt"}</pre>\
    If the student takes a look at the generated page, he will only see\
    <pre>&lt;img src="a_random_unrelated_file_name" alt="$name_img_accessibility_alt"></pre>\
    <p>The advantage of this method is that the file name will be hidden to the student.</p>\
