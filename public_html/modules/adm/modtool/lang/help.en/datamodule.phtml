Dependancies to a datamodule

If your module depends on another module with data like videos, images,
this last one must have an address of the form  <span class="tt wims_fname">data/xxx/xxx.xx</span>.
Write it here. If the datamodule is not on some wims serveur, there will be
an error message to ask the webmaster to download it.
