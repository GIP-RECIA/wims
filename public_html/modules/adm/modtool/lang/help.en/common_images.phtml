Common images

Choose $wims_name_yes if you want to put images in common (in the directory
<span class="tt fname">var.proc</span>images</span>) to all exercises.
If you do so, the class_importation is disabled.

For expert:
If you want to use a data module as <span class="tt fname">
modules/data/xx/yy</span>,
you will have the possibility after the creation of the module
to put the address in the file
<span class="tt fname">var.proc</span> : for example,
<span class="tt wims_code_words">common_images=datamodule/zoology/butterfly.fr/images</span>.
