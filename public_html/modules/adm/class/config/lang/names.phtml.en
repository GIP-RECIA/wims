 You cannot erase teaching materials of the class

 </p><p>
 This is an important security measure. If you feel that it is an
 inconvenience, think of the following two aspects.
 </p><p>
 On the one hand, suppose that your password is stolen and someone wants to erase
 something on this page. Your teaching activities would be greatly disturbed and
 your students would be penalized.
 </p><p>
 On the other hand, different teaching materials of the class are inter-dependent.
 If you erase some teaching materials without erasing those depending on them, your class
 will no longer work.
 !href cmd=help&special_parm=dependencies Examples.
 </p><p>
If you really want to clean this class, it is best to expire it
 (by setting its expiration date to today, the class will disappear the next
 morning), or

   <p>Exam sheets are based on worksheets to make up their

   behave erratically.
