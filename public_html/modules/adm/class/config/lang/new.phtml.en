      It is the teachers' responsability to backup their own teaching materials!
      The webmaster can only retreive lost worksheets or exercises exceptionally.
      Moreover, virtual classes which have not been regularly
      backed up will be considered as inactive and unimportant by the software,
      and may be erased at any time to make space for others.

    Your virtual class is too old! It already has $creatdays days.
  </div><p>
    It is highly recommended that you create a new virtual class structure at
    the end of each academic year. Continue using an old virtual class structure over
    the years will result in registry file and disk quota overflow, which risks
    blocking access to your class at crucial moments.

      your class at the end of the academic year.

      a new virtual class (or a class group or an institutional gateway) at the beginning
      of the next academic year.

      Restore the teaching materials you previously backed up to the new class
    (without necessarily restoring student accounts and activities that are obsolete.)

      Please tell this to the administrator of the class group gateway to which
      your class belongs.

      You can
      !href cmd=reply&job=arch backup
      the teaching materials of your current class then retore them to the newly
      created one.
