<b>Neighboring classes</b>.
<p>
Neighborhood relations among virtual classes on a same site can be
established. Two classes will become neighbors when supervisors of both have
!href cmd=help&special_parm=neibordecl declared
 the other as their neighbors. Teaching materials (documents,
exercises, worksheets) as well participant information can be
!href cmd=help&special_parm=import exchanged
 or
!href cmd=help&special_parm=share shared
 between neighboring classes, and participants having identical accounts in
neighboring classes can travel from one to the other without retyping their
passwords. A class can have as many neighbors as it likes.
</p><p>
Neighboring relations can be established between two classes with different
objectives: for supervisors, for participants, or both.
</p><p>
A neighboring relation for supervisors allows exchange/sharing of teaching materials
between the two classes. And that for participants allows exchange of
participant accounts, as well as direct travel of participants from one
class to the other.

Some examples of typical setup of neighboring class clusters can be found
