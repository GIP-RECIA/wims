  It is the teachers' responsability to backup their own teaching resources!
  The webmaster can only retreive lost worksheets or exercises exceptionally.
  Moreover, virtual classes which have not been regularly
  backed up will be considered as inactive and unimportant by the software,
  and may be erased at any time to make space for others.

 It is highly recommended that you create a new virtual class structure at
 the end of each academic year. Continue using an old virtual class structure over
 the years will result in registry file and disk quota overflow, which risks
 blocking access to your class at crucial moments.

  your class at the end of the academic year.

  a new virtual class (or a class group or an institutional gateway) at the beginning
  of the next academic year.

  (without necessarily restoring student accounts and activities that are obsolete.)

  Please tell this to the administrator of the class group gateway to which
  your class belongs.
