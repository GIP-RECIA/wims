<b>Warning.</b>The server does not check the file you submit!
<p>
Please do not modify the line structure of the file, the special
separating characters (`:' and `,'), nor names of users. Otherwise your
grades would become corrupt and useless.
<p>
<b>Structure of the source code file.</b> Each line must start with the character
`:', except for the second and the third lines.
<p>
The first line is the percentage of manually entered grade average in the
computation of the total.
<p>
The second line is the list of titles of the grade columns.
<p>
The third line is the list of weights of each column.
<p>
The other lines are comma-separated fields: field 1 is the login name, field 2
the real name of the user, and the rest are column by column grades.
