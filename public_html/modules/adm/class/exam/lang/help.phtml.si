 <p class="wimscenter" style="font-weight:bold;">Tuning the score registration.</p>
In the selective open mode, you can make time
restrictions for score registrations, by adding words <span class="tt wims_code_words">
&gt;yyyymmdd.hh:mm</span>
 (starting time) and/or
 <span class="tt wims_code_words">
&lt;yyyymmdd.hh:mm</span>
 (ending time). These must be in the
 SERVER's local time, and must be separated from other words by white spaces.
 <br>
 Cut times are used to let people take the exam in different sessions. A
 participant having worked on the exam before a cut time will have no access
 after the cut time.
 <br>
 Format of cut times: <span class="tt wims_code_words">yyyymmdd.hh:mm</span> (separate several cut times
 by white spaces).

  <p class="wimscenter" style="font-weight:bold;">Score dependencies</p>
Score dependencies means that a participant must get
required scores in other exercises of the worksheet before he/she can do
this one. For example, <span class="tt wims_code_words">1:50,2:30,3+4+5:60</span>
 means that the participant must get 50% success on exercise 1, 30% success on exercise 2,
 and an average of 60% success on exercises 3,4,5.
