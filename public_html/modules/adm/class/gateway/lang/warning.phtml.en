<h3 class="wimscenter"Sharing resources of another program</h3>
<p>
Your program is going to share all teaching resources
(exercises, sheets, exams, documents, votes) with the program
<em>$other_description</em> in level <em>$other_level</em>. This means that
any changes to the resources in one program will be automatically reflected
in all the other sharing programs.
</p><div class="wims_msg warning"><span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_warning</span>.
This experimental operation will erase existing teaching
resources in your program, and is <span class="wims_warning">IRREVERSIBLE</span>! You cannot stop the
resource sharing, and resource-sharing programs should not be deleted!
