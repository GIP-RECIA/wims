 As you have not defined a manager password, the server has generated a one-time
 password for this session. You can find it in the file
 <span class="tt">$wims_home/$oncename</span> in the WIMS server account. Please read that
 file and type the content in the field above.
 </p><p>
 If you want to define a permanent password (this is convenient but is less
 secure than a one-time password), you can put it into a file named
 <span class="tt">$wims_home/log/.wimspass</span>. But you <b>MUST</b> make this file readable only
 by you!
!else
 You have defined a permanent webmaster password. Please notice that
 you may also use one-time passwords, which is more secure.
 </p><p>
 In order to switch to one-time password mode, you have simply to erase the
 file <span class="tt">$wims_home/log/.wimspass</span> in the WIMS server account.
!endif

In any case, please be EXTREMELY careful when you manipulate the site
manager password. An intrusion as a webmaster may compromise ALL the data
on your server!
