:tech PATH
PATH
free

Search path for binary executables. It is safe to leave it with the default
value, unless you have a very special operating system setup.

:tech aliased_cgi
cgi to html address aliasing
choice
yes,no;$wims_name_yes,$wims_name_no
Set to yes if you want internet robots to see some WIMS contents as html
pages. Helps for making the site better referenced and better known, but
you need Apache 1.3 or up to get this to work correctly.
<p>
If you have just updated Apache httpd and if you have trouble with unknown
addresses when you activate this feature, run the script
<code class="tt">bin/apache-config</code>.
</p>
:tech aliased_getfile
getfile address rewriting
choice
yes,no;$wims_name_yes,$wims_name_no
Activating this allows you to get correct file names when downloading
wims-generated files: backup archives, student data in virtual classes, some
image files, etc. Otherwise all file downloads will default to the name
"wims.cgi" which has to be manually corrected when you save the file.
<p>
You may get into trouble downloading if your Apache httpd is not correctly
configured. In this case, say "no".
</p>
:housekeep backup_hour
Hour of daily backup
choice
-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,15,17,18,19,20,21,22; none,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,15,17,18,19,20,21,22
This is the hour when daily data backup will take place.
Choose an hour where the server is not busy, or pick none (-1) to disable daily backup.

:resources busyhours wims_busyhours
Busy hours of the server
free

You can list here the hours during which the server is most likely to be busy.
Some activities such as local module publication will be prohibited during
such periods. Give a list of words composed of two digits: for example,
<code class="tt">08 09 13 14</code>.

:graphics default_anim_format ins_format
Format of dynamic animations <span class="tt wims_warning">*</span>
choice
gif, mng
Graphics format for dynamic animations. There are only two possibilities:
gif or mng. You must be aware of the fact that many currently used browsers
are unable to show inline mng animations.

:graphics default_texposition
Default formula position / MathML
choice
0,1,2; low,high,MathML
TeX formulas are small graphics files that are middle-aligned with respect to the text line.
<p>There is an ancient middle-alignment bug from the beginning days of
Netscape, which aligns the middle of the picture against the base line of
the text. This of course makes the formulas appear too low, and WIMS patches
it by raising a bit the formulas. </p>
<p>However, recent browsers no longer carry this alignment bug. And for these
browsers, the patch makes the formulas too high with respect to text. This
parameter allows you to choose whether or not to activate the patch by
default. Note that users can define their own preferences. </p>
<p>The parameter can be used also to activate MathML translation.</p>
<p>If you change this value, do not think of your own browser,
but of those of your average users!</p>

:tech cgi_name
Name of the main cgi program <span class="tt wims_warning">!</span>
free

You can change this name only if you have correctly aliased things in the configuration file of your httpd.
For example, if you have run the script
in <code class="tt">bin/apache-config</code>,
you may try the names <code class="tt">index.html</code> or <code class="tt">wims.html</code>.
<p>
Do not change this if you do not know what you are doing! If you make it
wrong, you will have to manually recover your config.
</p>
:class class_limit wims_class_limit
Limit of the number of virtual classes
int
0,1000

:class class_regpass wims_class_regpass
Rights to create virtual classes
free

This parameter defines your site's access right for the creation of virtual
classes. It contains 3 comma-separated fields, defining respectively the
access right for creating individual classes, class groups and institution
portals. For each field, the following definitions are possible.
<dl>
<dt><code class="tt">all</code><dd>Every one can create classes.
<dt><code class="tt">deny</code><dd>Nobody is allowed to create classes.
<dt><code class="tt">email</code><dd>Every one can create classes, as long as he/she submits
his/her working email address. The site will check the effectiveness of this
email address.
<dt><code class="tt">passwd ****** ------</code><dd>The user must enter a password to access the
creation of classes. You can define the password as the second word
of the parameter (in replacement of <code class="tt">******</code> above), and
communicate the password to those who you allow to create classes.
A third word can be added. It allows you to define an email domain list for automatic dispatch
of the password to the email addresses whose domains are indicated (the domains must be separated by |).
<dt><code class="tt">Host names or IP numbers/code><dd>
 Only people connecting from the defined hosts will be allowed to create
classes.
$sitehelp
</dl>
Par exemple, si vous avez mis
<code class="tt">email,email,passwd  tartenpion ac-paris.fr|ac-versailles.fr</code>
la création de classes et de groupement de classes sera autorisée après vérification
d'un email valide (par l'envoi d'un code). Pour la création d'un établissement,
le mot de passe
<span class="tt">tartenpion</span> sera envoyé
automatiquement aux adresses dont le domaine est
<code class="tt">ac-paris.fr</code> ou <code class="tt">ac-versailles.fr</code>.
Pour les autres domaines, vous devrez le demander par mail..

Please notice that the webmaster (that is, you) always has the right to create virtual classes of any kind.

:class class_quota wims_class_quota
Disk quota for virtual classes in Meg

:graphics default_ins_format ins_format
Format of dynamic graphics <span class="tt wims_warning">*</span>
choice
gif, jpeg, png
Sorry for png advocates, but gif is the most compatible format
especially if you can install softwares producing compressed gif files.
The second choice is jpeg. png still have some compatibility problems.
<p>Note also that animated graphics format is not affected by this setting.</p>

:security,misc devel_modules
Access policy for modules under development
choice
open,close
If set to <code class="tt">close</code>, modules under development cannot be accessed without authentication.
In particular exercises cannot be inserted into a
worksheet of a class since a participant is not authenticated as modtool developper.
<p>
It is highly recommended that you choose <code class="tt">close</code>, in order
to avoid future problems. Module developers should be encouraged to
publish their modules into local space in order to make them usable by others.
</p>
:class examlog_limit
Limit of registered exam sessions for each participant
int
0,100
Please note that this is site-wide limitation.
Setups of individual classes cannot exceed this limit.
Registers of exam details may take up a lot of disk space,
so if this limit is too high, some very active classes may run
into disk quota problems.
<p>
If you set this limit to 0 or negative, no exam detail will be registered in
any virtual class.
</p>
:tech tmp_debug wims_tmp_debug
Debugging mode
choice
yes,no;$wims_name_yes,$wims_name_no
Turning on debugging mode allows some basic information to be shown

:tech idle_time
Delay before an idle class session is killed
choice
600,1200,1800,2400,3600,5400,7200,10800,14400,18000;10 min,20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 1 hour,1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours,4 hours, 5 hours
Reducing this may increase performance but slow visitors will find their sessions expired.
Usually an active user will touch his session at least once every 10 minutes, unless he is
working on a very hard exercise (a fairly rare case). However, killing the
session of the latter will result in huge frustration. So be careful!
<p>
If exams will be carried out on your installation, please note that this
delay should exceed the time allowance of any exam sheet.</p>

:tech idle_time2
Delay before an idle anonymous session is killed
choice
600,900,1200,1800,2400,3600,5400,7200,10800,14400,18000;10 min,15 min,20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 1 hour,1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours,4 hours, 5 hours
Reducing this may increase performance but slow visitors will find their sessions expired.
Usually an active user will touch his session at least once every 10 minutes, unless he is
working on a very hard exercise (a fairly rare case). If killing the
session of the latter will result in huge frustration, such activities
are less important when they are not in a virtual class.
<p>
This delay only applies to sessions without authentication. It cannot be bigger than delay for class sessions.
</p>
:tech idle_time3
Delay before an idle first-created session is killed
choice
300,360,480,600,720,900,1200,1800,2400,3600,7200;5 min,6 min,8 min,10 min,12 min,15 min,20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 1 hour,2 hours, 2 hours
If one creates a session without reusing it during this amount of seconds, the newly-created session will be removed.
<p>
This delay only applies to sessions without authentication. Creating a
session without reusing it is usually a behavior of internet robots.
</p><p>
This delay cannot be bigger than that for idle anonymous sessions.
</p>
:tech mail_opt
Options for !mailto command
free

Add options to the system command "mail" when using the !mailto command.
See the sytem's mail manual for details of possible options.
<p>
For example, if your system's mail command supports this, you can use
<code class="tt">-a "User-Agent: WIMS"</code> to add a User-Agent header to the mail sent
out by wims. Some providers require this to accept mails.
</p>

:tech mail_hidden wims_mail_hidden

choice
0,1;$wims_name_no,$wims_name_yes
Whenever possible, choose https connection to increase security.
An intrusion to your server as webmaster represents a great danger to your installation!
<p>WIMS is compatible with https. All you have to do is to configure your
httpd so that it accepts https requests.</p>

:security manager_site
Site maintenance connections must come from a site with this IP <span class="tt wims_warning">*</span>
free

You may put here several IP numbers.
Partial numbers such as 134.59.10. are accepted, but be aware that the more there are allowed sites,
the more will be your security risks.
The most secure site is 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
In any case, choose only site(s) you can trust.
An intrusion to your server as webmaster represents a great danger to your installation!

:log module_log
Log individual module informations
choice
1,0;$wims_name_no,$wims_name_yes
Many WIMS modules define their own log informations.
If you want to see these module informations, you can activate this (see also the definition of
module log file lengths).
Attention however that these log files will end up by using up a fair amount of disk spaces,
as there are hundreds of logging modules.

:log module_log_limit
Length limit (in bytes) of module log files
int
0,102400000
Length limit of module log files.
 There are some secondary general log files who also use this limit,
  so even if module log is set to no, this number still makes sense.

:housekeep site_accounting

:graphics texbasesize
Default TeX font size step <span class="tt wims_warning">*</span>
choice
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
This is the defaut font size in the graphics pictures generated by TeX
(that is, mathematics formulas).
This default size should be set to meet the text
font size of the browser of average visitors. The latter can change this
size to better fit their situation, but this change is not saved from one
session to another, except for virtual class users.
<p>
Do not adjust this font size only according to your own browser! Think of
others who may have different font sizes in their browsers.
</p>
<p>Each step increases (decreases) 9% of the linear size of the font.</p>

A trusted module may use administrative commands prohibited to usual modules.
These commands allow the module to modify or view server informations
usually hidden to the public. For security reasons, only administration
modules and modules written
by trusted authors can have access to these commands.
<p>
Administration modules (in the subdirectory adm/) and the home module are
automatically trusted. If you want to add other modules to this list, add
their addresses (the part after `module=' in the http request string) into

Cookie for anonymous visitors
choice
yes,no;$wims_name_yes,$wims_name_no
If you choose `yes', the server will send cookies to anonymous visitors, which helps tracking the user.
<p>
Note that cookies are not mandatory: even if
the visitor disables cookies, he will still be able to work normally on WIMS.
The main difference is that cookies can help them to keep their
personal preferences longer, and can improve server performance by
eliminating unnecessary session creations.
</p>
<p>The use of cookies for works in virtual classes is not affected by this parameter.</p>
