These exercises are OEF exercises and therefore have to be used in an OEF module.
They have two main parts 
<ul>
<li>the source file, which is created automatically
using the parameters entered in the Quicktool menu</li>
<li>the data file which contains the language items (i.e. questions or other resources) 
of your exercise and which has to be formatted according to the requirements for 
each exercise type. The data file is created by the user.
The data file contains one or more "sets" of language items which we will call 
"data" from now on (i.e. questions, pieces of text with gaps, words to be matched, etc.).
If there are several data sets in an exercise, these must be separated 
by a punctuation sign : written at the beginning of each "data set".

<pre>
&#58;beginning of the first data set 
data
data
data
end of the first data set

&#58;beginning of the second data set 
data

data
end of the first second set


&#58;beginning of the third data set 
data

end of the third data set
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A text file (<span class="tt">.txt</span>) and other files (audio (<span class="tt">.mp3</span>) and picture (<span class="tt">.jpg</span> or <span class="tt">.gif</span>)) 
can be added to an exercise (for example to provide a reading text or an audio recording
to be listened to...). These files can either be integrated into the exercise via the 
Quicktool menu or can be deposited directly into the user's Modtool account.
The names of these files must be specified in the Quicktool menu when the source file 
is being created. You will be asked to indicate the name of the module you wish to 
transfer them to in your Modtool account. 
Videos can also be embedded in your exercise by providing the URL of the video in the 
Quicktool menu.
If you wish to include a different piece of text, audio recording or a picture in each 
data set (i.e. have several of these in within a whole exercise) the format of 
the data file changes slightly. See the "Preferences for a data set" section in the help 
files for each exercise type for the format to follow.
</p><p>
WIMS will randomly select a data set from all the data sets provided when the 
learner clicks on the "renew" button, therefore each exercise suggested will 
be slighlty different from the previous one.
When using this random function it is recommended to create as many data sets 
as possible in a data file so as to make the exercise interesting and challenging 
for the learner.
</p><p>
In most exercise types several independent data sets can be used to create a series 
of exercises presented in a certain number of steps which is specified by the maker 
of the exercise in the Quicktool menu.
</p><p>
In this case, the data sets are selected randomly from all the data sets in the data file. 
You have to make sure that you have provided a sufficient number of data sets 
for the exercise to be interesting.
When configuring the number of steps in an exercise, it is best not to include 
too many data sets in each step, as the learner may become tired and demotivated 
if the exercise is too long. Because of the random function in WIMS the learner 
will probably encounter most, if not all the data sets in an exercise.

Explanations concerning the interface</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>name_of_data_file</b>: the name you wish to give to the file containing 
the data of the </li>
<li><b>instruction for the learner on how to do the exrcise</b>: this instruction 
must be at the beginning of the exercise.
If you wish to create a hyperlink to another webpage: 
<span class="tt">&lt;a target="wims_external" href="http=_adresse_url">nom&lt;/a></span>
</li>
<li><b>name_of_the_file</b>: help-text that explains to the learner how 
to answer in a separate window 
Tick <span class="tt">no</span> if you do not want to include a piece of text.
</li>
<li><b>name_of_audio_file</b>: name of the audio recording the learner is 
expected to listen to.
Tick <span class="tt">no</span> if you do not want to include an audio recording.
</li>
<li><b>name_of video_file</b>: URL of video file you wish to include. 
Tick <span class="tt">no</span> if you do not want to include a video.
</li>
<li><b>name_of_picture_file</b>: name of the picture the learner is expected 
to see in order to be able to do the exercise.
Tick <span class="tt">no</span> if you do not want to include a picture. 
 </li>
<li><b>size</b>: Sometimes you may be required to fill in the size (for example
the number of letters in a gap, the size of a picture, "width x height" in drag 
and drop exercises or "height x left width x right width" in matching exercises.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
File names must be written without leaving a space between the words in the name
(you can for example separate words with _ to write name_of_file). Special characters 
or letters with an accent are not allowed in the name of files either and the file
extension must be indicated (for example <span class="tt">.mp3</span> or <span class="tt">.jpg</span>). 
</p><p>
Certain pieces of information can be added at the beginning of the file (before the
beginning of the data set which starts with the colon :)
</p>
<pre>
instruction= 
reading_file1=no
audio_file1=no
video_file1=no
image_file1=no
size=

&#58;first data set

&#58;second data set
</pre>
<p>
If you do not want to add a text, audio, picture file or video to the exercise 
you are making, tick the corresponding <tt style='color:red;'>non</tt>. 
</p><p>
The information you enter in the interface will have priority over others.
In general, avoid using the semicolon and use its html code instead, this is &amp;#59;
