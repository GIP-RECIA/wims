<p>
$wims_name_quick_SELECTWORD requires the learner to select a word or words in a piece of text.
</p><p>
Usually there are two phases in a $wims_name_quick_SELECTWORD type exercise:
In the first phase certain words or group of words have to be identified by clicking on them
or by turning over (by clicking on them) the labels (or flashcards) to hide words 
(select then <span class="tt">flashcard</span>, the text is written twice, first usually, then with labels).
</p><p>
In the second phase the learner has to provide some sort of "explanation" for 
each word or group of words (for example a translation, identification of the 
grammatical form, the irregular form of a verb or a plural noun, etc.).
</p><p>
In the second phase of the exercise: 
</p>
<ol><li> 
You can decide which format you wish to use(clickfill, case, dragfill).
If there are several possible correct answers, they have to be separated by ||.
</li>
<li>
The feedback (correct answers) to the exercise can be displayed either 
in the text beside the word(s) or between the lines or outside the text.
</li></ol>

The following variants of an exercise can be created depending on the kind 
of task you wish the learner to do:
<ol><li>
It is possible not to have a second phase (just ask the learner to select 
words or group of words);
</li><li>
It is possible not to have a first phase (i.e. the learner doesn't have to first select words).
</li></ol>
<p>
The size of the blanks or labels in the second phase of the exercise have 
to be configured according to the length of the "explanation" required.

</p><p>
Several data sets can be included in an exercise but they will be displayed randomly .

</p><p>
A different picture, audio recording, introduction or title (i.e. piece of text) 
can be added to each data set.
