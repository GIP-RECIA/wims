used with all the different types of exercises (however, in certain exercise types check the "preferences"
section to see how words from the audio collection can be included by adding <span class="tt">audio="word"</span>
at the beginning of the data set. If the word is to be included from the swac audio collection,
the extension <span class="tt">.mp3</span>should not be specified.)
