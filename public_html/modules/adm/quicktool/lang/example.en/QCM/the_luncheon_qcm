: I saw her in the theatre

3,4
and I was happy to meet her again.
but I didn't remember her name.
but I couldn't recognize her
I sat down beside her

:Twenty years ago he

1,3
he wasn't a well-known writer
read a lot of books
made enough money to eat in restaurants
lived in a small flat

: She wanted to meet him

3
because she wrote a book too
but she didn't have time
to talk to him
because she found him handsome

:He didn't mind going to the Foyot's because

1,4
he was pleased by the invitation
he hoped to meet senators there
he thought it was an excellent restaurant
he hadn't yet learn to refuse invitations

:The woman was 

3
pretty
young
well-dressed
fat

:She ordered salmon

2
but nothing else
though it was not in season then
because she was very hungry
she never ate meat

:She suggested

1,2
that he should eat only a light lunch
drinking champagne
that he should have some caviare
they should have no alcohol to drink

:he panicked

2
he overloaded his stomach
he wasn't sure he'd be able to pay the bill
his mouth watered
he was late for another meeting

:After they had coffee

1
she had some peaches
he was full
she kept talking
she had a piece of cake

:The bill was so much that

1
he was broke
she had to leave the tip
it was funny
he had to borrow money from the bank
