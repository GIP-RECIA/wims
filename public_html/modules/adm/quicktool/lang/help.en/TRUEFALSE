The TRUEFALSE exercise is a specific type of multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ). 
A question/sentence is drawn randomly from among the list of questions/sentences 
suggested in a data set and a YES or NO type of answer is expected from the learner. 
An explanation (or feedback) to the question/sentence can be provided in the 
first line of each data set. If you do not wish to provide an explanation (or feedback), 
the first line must be left empty. The words specified in the variable <span class="tt">choice</span> 
must be exactly the same as those given in the answer (here YES and NO) ; 
in the example given to explain the syntax: True and False.
