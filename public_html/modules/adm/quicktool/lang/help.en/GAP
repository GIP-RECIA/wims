<p>
The $wims_name_quick_GAP exercise type requires the learner to fill in blanks (i.e. gaps)
in a piece of text.
There are several different types of GAP exercises:
</p>
     <ul>
       <li> <span class="tt">case</span>,<span class="tt">nocase</span>: the blank has to be filled in by typing letters
            (difference between lowercase and uppercase is not taking account with nocase).  </li>
       <li> <span class="tt">clickfill</span>: words to be dragged and dropped in the blank</li>
       <li> <span class="tt">dragfill</span>: words to be dragged and dropped in the blank(each word can
       be used just once. Once used, the word disappears from the list of choices. )
       <li> <span class="tt">menu</span>: drop down menu</li>
       <li> <span class="tt">mark</span>: words to be clicked on</li>
     </ul>
<p>
You can decide how many attempts the learner may make before providing him/her with
  the correct answers.
</p><p>
You can also decide to display or not the answers the learner has been unable to find
at the end of the exercise.
</p><p>
After each attempt, only the wrongly answered blanks have to be completed by the learner.
The correct answers will not have to be entered again.

 You can decide to provide aids (the number of letters in the missing word(s), or some
 letters from the missing word(s), or the audio recording of the word(s) as long as it
 is part of the swac audio collection or if you have previously recorded the word and
 saved it in your Modtool account, a personalized message or the right answer is shown briefly).
Please enter the word you wish the learner to see when he/she uses the help function
in the prompt section. The learner will be able to see the help provided if he/she hovers
over this prompt with the mouse (for example: aide, help, ayuda).
</p><p>
Currently 39 blanks are allowed.
</p><p>
Several correct answers may be provided for one blank.
  In the <span class="tt">menu</span> and <span class="tt">mark</span> type GAP exercise, the <span class="tt">shared list</span>
  option allows you to suggest all the gapped out words in the text for the learner
  to choose from in each blank.

Otherwise at least two words (or group of words) have to be suggested for the learner
to choose from in each blank (check the syntax). Additional words (distractors) can
be provided as possible choices.
</p><p>
The list of words the learner will have to choose from can also be specified in
the variable <span class="tt">choice</span> in the data file (see second example here below).
In this case the list will appear in the drop down menu for each blank whether
you have activated the  <span class="tt">shared list</span> option or not.
</p>
:format
<pre>
:He's not ??there,their,theirs?? today !
:Those students over ??there,their,theirs??  are naughty so
??their,there,theirs??  teacher is cross.
:Those books over ??there,their,theirs??  in ??their,there,theirs??
bags are not??theirs,there,their?? but mine.
:I'm going ??there,their,theirs?? to see ??their,there,theirs?? friends.
</pre>
<h3>$wims_name_Syntax</h3>
Gaps are marked with ??word(s)??. The correct word(s) must be written in the first position,
wrong alternatives in the second, third and subsequent positions.
Here below is an example of the syntax

<pre>
:text ??correct word(s) for the 1st gap,1st wrong word(s) for the 1st gap, 2nd wrong word(s) for the 1st gap??
text ??correct word(s) for the 2nd gap,1st wrong word(s) for the 2nd gap?? text
??correct word(s) for the 3rd gap,1st wrong word(s) for the 3rd gap?? text
??correct word(s) for the 4th gap,1st wrong word(s) for the 4th gap,2nd wrong word(s) for the 4th gap?? text
</pre>

<span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_remark</span>: If there are only a few words
to choose from, these can be listed in the variable called<span class="tt">choice</span>.
Distractors can be added to this list as well. The syntax will slightly change and will be
<pre>
choice= correct word(s) for the 1st gap,correct word(s) for the 2nd gap,correct word(s) for the 3rd gap,1st distractor,2nd distractor
:text ??correct word(s) for the 1st gap?? text ??correct word(s) for the 2nd gap?? text
??correct word(s) for the 3rd gap?? text ??correct word(s) for the 2nd gap??
</pre>
<span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_remark</span>: In order to increase the number of sentences
that appear in an exercise, certain words can be written between braces { }
i.e. {altenative1,alternative2,alternative3}.
A comma must be used to separate the words in the braces. A different word (or piece of text)
will be selected randomly by the software program every
time the learner renews the exercise. If the text contains commas, the commas
must be replaced by their html code which is
(&amp;#44;)
<pre>
:{I am,He is,She is,They are,Mary is} ??there?? !
:Those {students,children,boys,girls} over ??there?? are naughty, so
{??their?? teacher is cross.,
??their?? headmaster will be angry.}
:Those books over ??there?? in ??their??
bags are not??theirs?? but {mine,Peter's,hers,Mary's}.
:{I'm going,He's running,They are walking}??there?? to see ??their?? {friends,parents,brother,grandparents}.
</pre>

<span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_remark</span>: When there are several possible correct answers,
they have to be separated by  | . For example,
<pre>
:first possible correct word(s)|second possible correct word(s)|third possible correct word(s),distractor??
:The ??organisation|organization,organize?? of this meeting is difficult.
</pre>
<p>
If the learner provides a wrong answer, the first correct answer in the list will be suggested as the right answer.
(<span class="tt">organisation</span> in the example above)
</p><p>
<span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_remark</span>: Preferences for a data set.

If you wish to add a different audio recording, a different title (i.e. text) or
a different introduction to each data set (i.e. exercise), the first line must have the following format
</p>
<pre>
:audio=recording_file.mp3 image=picture_file.jpg title="your text" intro="instructions"
</pre>
<span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_remark</span>: Adding a personalised aid. You may want
to add one or more personalised aids for each (or certain) blank in a 'case' type gapfill exercise. If you add
several aids for the same blanks, one will be drawn randomly and displayed.
In this case the following format is required.
<pre>text text ??gap //help=[{personalised aid number 1}]??
text text text text ??gap //help=[{personalised aid number 2}]?? text text<br>
for example : My ??sister //help=[{opposite of brother, a family member}] is coming to Paris tomorrow.
</pre>
