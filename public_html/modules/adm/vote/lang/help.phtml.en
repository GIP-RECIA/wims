The content of a vote can be a html text, reinforced by the same facilities as
for forum messages, plus the following commands.
<dl>
 <dt><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\menu{Yes,No}</span>
	<dd>A choice by menu.
	</dd>
 <dt><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\list{A,B,C,D}</span>
	<dd>A choice by buttons in a vertical list.
	</dd>
 <dt><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\radio{very bad, rather bad, rather good, very good}</span>
	<dd>A choice by horizontal buttons.
	</dd>
 <dt><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\checkbox{A,B,C,D}</span>
	<dd>Several choices by horizontal buttons.
	</dd>
 <dt><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\uservar{vname,val0,val1,...}</span>
	<dd>Register the immediately preceding choice in an individual
	variable for the participant, under the name <span class="tt">vname</span>. This
	variable will take the value <span class="tt">val0</span> by default, <span class="tt">val1</span>
	if the participant chooses the first option, etc. <br>
	This variable may then be used to define individualized access to
	sheets or exams, by putting the word <span class="tt wims_code_variable">\vname</span> among the
	restrictions of the sheet or exam.
	In this case, it is possible to give the maximum number of participants allowed to choose
	an option: each choice must begin by this number followed by <span class="tt wims_code_words">:</span>
	For instance,
<pre>
\list{46:Seance 1 at 8.00,
46:Seance 2 at 10.00,
40:Seance 3 at 13.00}
</pre>
  Beware though, using the same technical variable in several votes may generate conflicts.
  </dd>
 <dt><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\textarea</span>
 <dd>Textarea only when the vote is anonymous.
	</dd>
  <dt><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\inputfield</span>
  <dd>Une zone de texte libre mais limitée à une ligne, utilisable uniquement
    lorsque le vote est anonyme. Les résultats sont classés à des espaces près
    (en développement).</dd>
</dl>

  A vote may contain up to $max_parms choice fields.

  <ul>
    <li><b>$wims_name_title</b> : the title of the vote.</li>
    <li><b>$wims_name_Type</b>:
    <ul>
      <li><b>$name_anonymous </b>: in an anonymous vote nobody knows
     who answered what (it is for instance impossible to go back
     and double check what your own answer was.)
      </li>
      <li><b>$name_trace with log files</b>: this type is similar to the anonymous type vote
    except that the answers provided by a participant can be identified,
    however  the identity of the participant is not revealed.</li>
      <li><b>$name_nominative</b>:  each participant's answers can be consulted ( the "free response"
    area cannot be used with this type of vote.)</li>

   <li><b>$wims_name_Status</b>: refers to one of the statuses described below:

Several modes are available:
<ul><li>
  <b>$name_free</b> :  you can create
  a vote simply using the commands given in the help.
  </li><li>
  !readproc adm/lang/sheetexam.phtml.$lang
  <b>$name_accessvar</b>: with this form, you can allow registration in different time slots.
   The technical variable then created variable will allow you for instance to define individual access
   to sheets or exams. To do this, simply select
  <span class="tt wims_code_words">$(name_allowtype[4])</span>.
  </li><li>
  <b>$name_group</b> : you can create groups. The system will ask you a variable name
   (let's say you called it <span class="tt wims_code_variable">my_variable</span>. Using
   it, you can then send emails or provide the photo board by group,
   sort csv files obtained in the class according to group (provided <b> in this case </ b>
   that you asked the variable <span class="tt wims_code_variable">var_my_variable</span>).
  Other uses are planned.
  </li>
  <li>Beware however, using the same technical variable in several votes may generate conflicts.</li></ul>

  Variable names must be different from variable names already used by WIMS (e.g.
do not use <span class="tt wims_code_variable">exam1</span>, ... , <span class="tt wims_code_variable">sheet1</span>, ...,
<span class="tt wims_code_variable">manual1</span>, ...).
<br>
The models <span class="tt wims_code_words">$name_free</span> and <span class="tt wims_code_words">$name_group</span> are not available when the votes are shared with another class.
