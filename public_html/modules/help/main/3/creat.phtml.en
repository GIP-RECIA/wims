If you are a teacher, and if you want to create a virtual class on this site
for the work of your students, try to
!href session=$prefix_session&+module=adm/class/regclass click here
. You may also
!href session=$prefix_session&+module=adm/class/classes&type=example click here
 to see whether this site contains an example class (or a class which is not
protected by a password). If so, you can register to it and see how it
works (under student's view).
</p><p>
Each WIMS site may has its own policy on class creations. Some accepts
free virtual classes from anyone, others may charge maintenance fees or
pose other restrictions. Please check with the site manager for the
conditions.
</p><p>
For security reasons, you must have a working email address at the moment
when you create your class. After you have filled the form for the necessary
informations about your class, a random code is generated by the server.
This code is sent to you email address, and you can get it only by reading
your mail. You should then resubmit this code to an html form for
authentification, otherwise your creation of class will be refused.
</p><p>
This email address will also be made visible by the registered participants
(students) of your class, allowing them to send messages to you.
</p><p>
After the class is created, you becomes the supervisor of the class, and you
can sign in to the class as such, in order to manage the class (creation of
worksheets, assignment of works into worksheets, control of student
progress, etc.)
</p><p>
There are several ways in which you can let your students to register into
your classes, through the use of a <em>`class password'</em> which you may enter
when create your class:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You create your class `world open', by putting an empty class
 password, thus allowing anybody to register as participant.
 This mode is not advisable because you loose control to your class. Many
 sites will also disallow such classes (you may get your class immediately
 closed by the site manager), except for some example classes set up by
 the site manager.
 </li><li>You assign a class password and keep it secret. In this way you will be
 the only person who can register people to the class.
 </li><li>You assign a class password and communicate it to your students. Using
 this password, your students can register to the class by themselves, but
 others cannot getin.
</li></ul>
