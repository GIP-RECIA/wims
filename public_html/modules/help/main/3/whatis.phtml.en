A virtual class is a space where students can work under the guidance of a
supervisor (teacher). All the activities of a virtual class, either for supervisor
or for participants, are carried out on the users' web browser, via
connections to the WIMS site.
<p>
When a virtual class is
!href module=$module&chapter=$chapter&open=$open,$(chapter)_creat#creat created
 by the teacher who then becomes the supervisor of it,
students can register into the class as participants. The supervisor assigns
works for the students, organized in worksheets.
</p><p>
When putting work items (exercises) into worksheets, the supervisor also
determines the number of points each student should gather on the item.
Each time a student (totally or partially) successes in solving an exercises,
he/she is attributed a certain number of points (from 0 to 10)
<small>
!href module=$module&chapter=1&open=$open,1_exo#exo detail
</small> for this success. This number of points is registered by the server,
and the supervisor can consult the achievements of each student, either
globally or individually, as a whole or exercise by exercise.
</p><p>
When connected into the class as the supervisor, teacher can also
!href module=$module&chapter=4&open=$open,4_oef#oef create
 his/her own specific interactive exercises and then insert into worksheets.
These exercises automatically take advantage of the standard features of
WIMS: random pickup of exercises and/or parameters, registered scores, etc.
</p><p>
Each virtual class also contains a message board allowing supervisor and
students to exchange views in different ways. Messages may contain
mathematical formulas in a very convenient way, and readers will see the
formulas automatically formatted.
</p><p>
Planned for the future:
test sheets with sophisticated random exercise generation and work time
limitation will also be available. Software to analyze student performance
based on registered data on his/her work is under study.
