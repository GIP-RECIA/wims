WIMS (WWW Interactive Multipurpose Server)
allows you to work on mathematics interactively via the Internet.
</p><p>
Unlike most interactive activities on the Internet through the use of
javascript or java, WIMS interactively processes your requests on the server.
This allows it to make very sophisticated computations for you.
</p><p>
For an ordinary user, WIMS is a web site just like any other web site. On
which, you can consult interactive textbooks, answer mathematical exercises,
make computations and draw curves or surfaces, or play math games, by
clicking on buttons or pictures just like any other web page.
</p><p>
By clicking on buttons or pictures, you send a ``request'' back to the server,
which computes your request and send you back the result. The computations
are often so powerful and sophisticated that you would never imagine it to
be possible to do simply through a few clicks.
</p><p>
Sometimes, javascript and/or java applets are also used to reinforce this
interactivity.
</p><p>
The structure of WIMS is particularly interesting for teaching activities,
in which the server can individually analyze the behavior of students, and
propose activities to each of them according to his/her
learning requirements.
