``numlist'' can be a single integer, a comma-separated list of
integers, or a range of integers.
<br>
A positive integer denotes the number of $numlist_type in $numlist_str
counted from the beginning,
with ``1'' corresponding to the first
$numlist_type. A negative integer denotes the number of $numlist_type from
the end of $numlist_str: ``-1''
means the last $numlist_type, ``-2'' means
the next-to-last $numlist_type, etc. <p>
The syntax for a range of integers is
``n1'' to ``n2''.
For example, ``2'' to ``-2''
means the whole $numlist_str except the first
and the last $(numlist_type)s.
