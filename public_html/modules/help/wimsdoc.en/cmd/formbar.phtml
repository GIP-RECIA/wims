mean:Creates a bar of radio buttons under a previously defined html form. <br>\
  This bar should be arranged to represent values from small to big. No prompt is given \
  to the user, except the indication that left is smaller. In the parameters, ``name'' defines the\
  name field of the menu, and the values of the menu are either integers going from ``n1'' to ``n2''\
  (in the first syntax), or items in the list ``selectlist''. <br>\
  The default of the menu will be the current value of the variable ``&#36;name''.
