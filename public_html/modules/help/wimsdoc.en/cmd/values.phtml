syntax:!values ``fns'' for ``v''=``v1'' to ``v2'' [step ``st'']\
$ !values ``fns'' for ``v'' in ``v1,v2,v3,...''
mean:Outputs a list of values of ``fns'' with variable ``v'' replaced successively by values \
  ``v1'', ..., ``v2''. <p>In the second syntax, the values are given with respect \
  to each item in the list ``v1,v2,...''. </p><p>\
  ``fns'' may be a comma-separated list of functions. </p><p>\
  This command can also be used to make recursions. If the functions\
  ``fns'' contain a variable named ``last'', this variable\
  will take the value of the last step each time. And the starting value\
  can be put into the WIMS variable <span class="tt">&#36;recursion_start</span>.\
