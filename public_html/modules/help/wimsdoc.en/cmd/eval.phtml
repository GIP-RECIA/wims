tit:eval
type:$type_var
alias:evalue
syntax:!eval ``expr''
mean:Returns the numerical value of the expression ``expr''. ``expr'' must evaluate to \
  a real number (under the current version of wims). The evaluation is internally done in double\
  precision, but the print precision can be changed by setting the variable\
  ``wims_print_precision'' (whose default value is 8). <br>\
  If an error is found in the expression ``expr'', 0 is returned.\
  (I know that this is very bad; I just have no time to make everything right.)
