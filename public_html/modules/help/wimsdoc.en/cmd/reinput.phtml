syntax:!reinput ``string''
mean:Prepares ``string'' to be inserted into a form input or textarea.\
  <p>\
  Browsers translate &amp; primitives into corresponding (special) characters\
  even when these primitives occur in input or textarea fields. Also, if\
  ``string'' contains html tags, they may confuse browsers. You can\
  use this command on the string (usually derived from an earlier user input)\
  before inserting them back into a input or textarea, to avoid the above problems.\
