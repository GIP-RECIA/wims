syntax:!getopt ``name'' in ``string''
mean:This command allows to extract the definition of a word in ``string'' under the form ``name=value''.\
  <p>\
  It returns the defined ``value'' in the string, or the ``name'' itself if it appears in ``string''\
  but if there is no ``='' sign following it, or an empty string if ``name'' does not appear \
  in ``string'' as a word.\
  </p><p>\
  ``value'' can be a multi-word string, if it is enclosed by a pair of parentheses, brackets, \
  curly braces or double quotes. The enclosing parentheses etc. will be removed from the output.\
  </p><p>\
  Spaces are allowed before and/or after the ``='' sign.\
  </p>
