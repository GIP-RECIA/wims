syntax:!translate [internal] ``s1'' to ``s2'' in ``string''\
!translate [internal] ``s1'' in ``string'' to ``s2''
mean:String manipulation: variable substitution is first done on ``string''. \
  Then all occurences of the first (resp. second, ...)\
  character of ``s1'' is replaced by the first (resp. second, ...)\
  character of ``s2''. <br>\
  When the keyword ``internal'' is absent, the Linux utility ``tr'' is called to make the translations,\
  therefore regular expressions are accepted in ``s1'' and ``s2''. \
  Please refer to the man page of ``tr'' for details.
