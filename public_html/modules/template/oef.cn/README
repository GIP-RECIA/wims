To install OEF exercises in a module :

 1. Create a module whose type is OEF

 2. For each exercise, create a new file in your module, with extension
    oef and in the directory src/ (example : scr/euclide.oef). Write or paste
    your source text in the text area showing up. Save changes.

 3. Test your module

 4. modify intro.phtml and endhook.phtml to your needs, and test again.

%%%%%%%%%%%% If you want to use it directly on a local server
