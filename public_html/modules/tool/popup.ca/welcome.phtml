  This is a searchable database of many straightforward computational forms.
  It also registers all user requests, and will be extended and
  completed according to the demand.
  <p>
  The particularity of these forms is that when you click on a button, 
  a popup window will appear, showing the result.
  Each of these forms is an independent entity, which can either be used
  within this module, or be copied and inserted into your own web pages, 
  and you can freely modify them.
