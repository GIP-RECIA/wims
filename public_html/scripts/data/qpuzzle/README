How to add a new photo to the qpuzzle game:

1. Copy a gif file into the photos/ directory. (No bigger than 320x240,
   otherwise users will wait too long to load.)

2. From the home directory of the module, run the script makepieces with the 
  name of the photo as parameter (no leading directory name, nor extension).

3. Modify files intro.phtml and var.init, to add the name of the photo.
  (add one line in intro.phtml, and add just the name in the definition
   of photolist, in var.init.)
