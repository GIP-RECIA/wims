Each file *.data in this zone defines a circuit type.

The name of the subdirectory is the number of components to fill in the type.

File syntax: datafile.

Record 0: comment.

Record 1: description (text).

Record 2: x,y,n,(pairing data)
(x,y)=size, n=number of components.

pairing data is a list of first components of each component pair in series.
The second component of the pair must be at the right or the bottom of the
first one, according to the orientation of the component. The distance between
the two must be 3 units.

If the first component of the pair is a wire, the second one will appear
in the middle of the two.

Record 3: component information.
One line per component, format x1,y1,x2,y2,o,e1,e2
(x1,x2)=position of component, (x2,y2)=position of annotation, o=orientation.
o=0: horizontal. o=1: vertical.

e1,e2 (optional): extending wire distances (with respect to the center).
Should be one positive and one negative.

Record 4: Draw command for wiring and fixed components.

Record 5: dot positions.

The two scripts "data2ps" and "ps2data" translates the datafile to and
from postscript circuit files recognizable by xcircuit.

mksymbols generate compdata.for_sh and the images in gifs/circuits

When adding a component, check if it should be in the list
