:At least & word shoukld be selected in each exercise.
\integer{minmark=1}

:Maximum number of words that should be selected.
\integer{maxmark=8}

:Main data.
<p>Write one piece of text per line, and separate lines (and texts) by a semi-colon.
(Therefore the texts themselves cannot contain semi-colons. If you want to add semi-colons in a text, use the html code of the semi-colon)
</p><p>
The words to be selected should be written between a pair of double-question marks "??".
Each field contains a list of words separated by commas.
The word shown to the student will be randomly drawn from the list.
If it is the word in the first position
it should be selected by the learner when exercising.
If the second alternative is drawn, it should not be selected.
You may decide not to provide a first alternative and leave this part of the field  empty.
</p><p>
Up to a hundred selectable words can be inserted in each sentence.</p>
