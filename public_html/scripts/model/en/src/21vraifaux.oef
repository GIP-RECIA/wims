:Choose the true sentence from a list.
A number of sentences are picked from a list.
We must identify and note those that are true.
Good and bad sentences are selected randomly from respective lists.
The number of good sentences in each presentation is not necessarily fixed.
<p>
The more data (sentences) are abundant,
 the more the exercise is random and repeatable.
But you can also do exercises with just the right phrases but no more.
It will be in this case a multiple choice with several good choices.
