<h2 class="wimscenter">The <span class="tt">minimal</span> style of symtext</h2>
<p>
This is the style that contains only the minimal set of identifications.
It is especially useful for linguistic applications. Called without option,
it detects any difference between the words. Only multiple spaces are
compacted. But one can use options to do some identifications (upper- and
lower-cases, letters with or without accent, etc.).
</p>
<p>
No dictionary is defined for this style for the time being.

!set n=!recordcnt symtext/$style/macros.help
!if $n>0

Definitions of positional macros: (recall that to replace a word
(a, b, c, etc.) by a group of several words, one has to enclose the latter
by a pair of brackets.)
