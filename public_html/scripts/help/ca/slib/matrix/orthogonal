slib_title=Generates a random orthogonal matrix
slib_parms=3\
2,matrix size m\
4, N coefficient range\
2,product of n reflexions
Q,coefficient ring: Q for the time being ,R,C,G (Gauss ring)

slib_out=the generated matrix
slib_comment= product of n reflexions associated to n independant linear vectors  (so its determinant is (-1)^n), the vector  coefficients are bounded by N
