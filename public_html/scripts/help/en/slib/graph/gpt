slib_out=Generation of a graph without circuit to be used with flydraw when the option word is raw\
or is empty : draw source, \
matrix, matrix of ranks, matrix of positions of the vertex, \
position of points
slib_comment=<span class="tt">s</span> can be replaced by a matrix corresponding to such a graph (no check is done). \
In such case only 4 parameters are asked.\
<br/>The first item of the output is: by default, the flydraw code; \
the address of the generated image if the option word is <span class="tt">url</span> ; \
the html code for inserting image is already inserted for the option <span class="tt">html</span>.\
When the option word is <span class="tt">url</span> or <span class="tt">html</span>, the two last items are the size of the image.
