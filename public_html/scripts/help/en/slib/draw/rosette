slib_out=Drawing of cyclic or dihedral rosette.
slib_comment=The rosette is drawn by applying rotations \
and reflections to the given module, according to the chosen symmetry group. \
The module parameter can contain any flydraw code (included in square \
brackets). In order to get a drawing with the requested symmetry type, \
you have to take care that the given module is asymmetrical and that any \
<em>overlapping</em> is coherent with the applied transformations \
(e.g. the module should be contained in the square \
(0,0)(0,sqrt(2)),(sqrt(2),sqrt(2)),(sqrt(2),0)). You have to be \
particularly careful if you use multiple colours (as shown in some of the \
examples below). \
The first item of the output is: by default, the flydraw code (option word <span class="tt">raw</span>); \
the address of the generated image if the option word is <span class="tt">url</span> ; \
the html code for inserting image if the option word is the option <span class="tt">html</span>.
