slib_title=Draw solutions of a differential system (with jsxgraph).
slib_out=Draw solutions of x'(t)=f1(t,x,y), y'(t)=f2(t,x,y) in the plane (x,y) \
 from init points. The equations may depend on some sliders.

slib_comment=The jsxgraph program comes from an example on the website of jsxgraph.\
 The drawing is based on the classic Runge-Kutta method (rk4)
