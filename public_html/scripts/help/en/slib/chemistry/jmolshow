The sturcture file should preferably stored in the data directory of a module or\
 in the case of a class in the image directory (thus the address is \
<code class="wims_code_words">\imagedir/nom_du_fichier</code>). <br>\
You have the possibility to load a structure file from the \
<i>National Cancer Institute</i> database, indicating its IUPAC or SMILES code.\
In this case, the name/code has to be preceded by a @.\
