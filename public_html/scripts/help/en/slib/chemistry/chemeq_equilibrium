slib_out= a matrix or a table whose lines help to check the equilibrium \
of the given equation.

<br/><b>Important notice</b>: when there are electrons or ions in the \
equation, the matrix has an <i>odd</i> number of lines, the last one being \
the charge balance. When the molecules are not charged electrically, the \
matrix has an <i>even</i> number of lines.
