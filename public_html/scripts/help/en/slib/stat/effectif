slib_title=Effectifs of statistical series in classes

slib_out= [effectifs of classes], [classes data]
slib_comment= data : [x_1,...,x_n] ; classes data: [a_1,...,a_m] \
 (with min and max add if necessary);\
 if there are only 2 numbers in classes data, the first one is the smaller, \
 the second one is the width of classes;\
 if there is no second parameter, classes are created of width ceil(4*n^(1/4)).
