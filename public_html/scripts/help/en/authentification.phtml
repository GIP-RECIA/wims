<p>
Several authentication methods are available in WIMS:
</p>
<ol><li>
Authentication by WIMS.
</li><li>
CAS authentication to authenticate users with single sign on (SSO). 
The teacher must know the URL address supplied to him by the organization 
he belongs to as well as his students.
</li><li>
 Authentication by an ldap directory (depends on the permissions given 
to the WIMS server by the directory).
</li><li>
Authentication by a php script (uses wims's raw module and needs for now 
installing simpleSAMLphp).
</li></ol>

<p>
On the other hand, at the time of registration, data concerning the 
participant's identity (name, firstname, email address, etc.) can be 
searched in an ldap directory (same restriction as above for the ldap).
</p><p>
Here is some information about the registration or authentication process for each case:
</p>
<h3>
WIMS authentication (default)
</h3>
<p>This is the original authentication in WIMS.</p>
<ul><li>
Either the teacher registers all participants by choosing for each one his 
username, identity and a password.
</li><li>
Or each participant enters the password for the class given by the teacher 
and registers by choosing a username and stating his identity, and a password.
</li></ul>
<p>The participant then enters the class using this username and password.</p>

<h3>
CAS authentication
</h3>
<ul><li>
The teacher must have configured his class by entering the address 
of the CAS host he want to use, either when creating the class, 
or using the <span class="tt wims_code_words">Configuration/Maintenance</span> 
page (clic on <span class="tt wims_code_words">Authentication</span> in the 
left menu) .
</li><li>
The teacher then gives the password of the class to future participants.
</li><li>
The participant clicks the enter button on the line showing his class. 
The CAS authentication window appears. He enters his CAS login. 
If he is not yet registered, the class password is requested. 
If successful, he is asked for his username and password. 
He should also accept the terms of use. 
If he is already registered, he enters directly into the class.
</li><li>
The teacher can also register himself participants. In this case, 
the participant only needs to accept the conditions of use.
</li></ul>
<h3>
CAS authentication and ldap identification.
</h3>
<p>The teacher must have configured his class by entering the address 
of the CAS host he want to use, using the 
<span class="tt wims_code_words">Configuration/Maintenance</span> 
page (clic on <span class="tt wims_code_words">Authentication</span> in the left 
menu) and entering the technical ldap parameters. He must also verify that 
the directory server accepts requests from WIMS server (contact the manager of the directory).
</p><p>
Everything goes as in the case of a simple authentication by CAS, 
but the identifiers (name, ...) are automatically filled. 
The CAS and ldap username must be the same.
</p>

<h3>
ldap authentication and ldap identification.
</h3>
 
<p>Everything works as in CAS authentication and ldap identification.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul><li>
<span class="wims_warning">
It is not advisable to change the authentication type when participants 
are already registered.
</span>
</li><li>
In the case of external (to WIMS) authentication, an <i>internal</i> 
identifier is assigned automatically. It will not be used for authentication
 but remains the identifier of the WIMS participant. 
There is no more WIMS password (more precisely it is hidden).
</li><li>
Default settings may have been defined by the site manager if the 
classes depend primarily on a single institution.
You may redefine them for your own class.
<br/>
Here is an example of parameters for an ldap authentication :
<pre>
ldap_host: ldap.u-psud.fr
ldap_port: 389
ldap_version: 3
ldap_base: ou=people,dc=u-psud,dc=fr
ldap_branch: ou=people,dc=u-psud,dc=fr
ldap_uid: uid
ldap_login: supannAliasLogin
</pre></li><li>

If the ldap authentication fails, the default wims authentication
is automatically proposed.
</li></ul>
