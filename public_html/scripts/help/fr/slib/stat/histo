slib_out=Plot of the histogram (+ size of the image when the option word is \
<span class="tt">url</span> or <span class="tt">html</span>).
slib_synonyme=plot frequency, frequency plot
slib_comment=The first item of the output is: by default, the flydraw code (option word <span class="tt">raw</span>); \
the address of the generated image if the option word is <span class="tt">url</span> ; \
the html code for inserting image if the option word is the option <span class="tt">html</span>.\
<ul><li>If <span class="tt">type_histo</span> is not given, the slib produces an histogram of\
the data values in vector <span class="tt">[data]</span> using the intervals characterized by\
<span class="tt">[position]</span> : the values of <span class="tt">[data]</span> are the areas of the bars of the\
histogram. If <span class="tt">[position]</span> is a list of numbers which determine the \
endpoints of  intervals, its length is  1 + length of <span class="tt">[data]</span> \
</li><li>If <span class="tt"> type_histo</span> is <span class="tt">baton</span> (resp. <span class="tt">stem</span>), \
the slib produces a  plot of data points in <span class="tt">[data]</span> connected \
the horizontal axis by vertical bars (resp. vertical lines) at the \
x-coordinates specified in <span class="tt">[position]</span> ; <span class="tt">[data]</span> and \
<span class="tt">[position]</span> must have the same length.\
</li><li>If <span class="tt">type_histo</span> is <span class="tt">step</span> or <span class="tt">stair</span>, the slib\
produces a 'stairstep' graph of the data points in <span class="tt">[data]</span>. As <span class="tt">[position]</span>\
specifies the endpoints of the horizontal lines, its length is  1 +\
length of <span class="tt">[data]</span>.\
With <span class="tt">stair</span>, the horizontal lines are not linked together by \
vertical lines.</li></ul>\
<br/> If <span class="tt">xtics</span> is followed by a number <span class="tt">n</span>, there are <span class="tt">n</span> graduations. \
If it is followed by a vector, the graduations are on the intervals \
and the text is those given in the vector.\
