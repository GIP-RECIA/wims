,the input text (embedding delimiter: `??')
slib_out=Text output with each choice in isolated rows
slib_comment=This is improved from text/cutchoices, with the possibility\
for the cut field at the beginning of a line or immediately following another\
cut fields. It also allows (and translates to html code) the semi-colons\
embedded in the input.\
<p>For example, on the input text\
<pre>The class has ??3,5,6,7?? pupils with average score of ??20,30,40??</pre>\
will be transformed into\
<pre>\
The class has;3,5,6,7;pupils with average score of;20,30,40\
</pre>\
The lines of even numbers may then be singled out for creating embedded\
choices.
