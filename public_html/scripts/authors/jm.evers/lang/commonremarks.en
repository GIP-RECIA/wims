: Question
: You should write a pair of coordinates with a : or ;
: You should write coordinates like (x:y) or (x;y)
: You have used the letter &#39;o&#39; as number &#39;0&#39; ?
: You should do your own calculations<br />there is a +/- sign in your answer.
: You have forgotten one abs-sign.<br />Syntax : abs(x) or |x|
: You have made a small syntax error:<br />write $testvar1 instead of $testvar2
: You did not fill in a pair of coordinates.
: In case of multiple coordinates, write<br />(x1:y1) and (x2:y2) and (x3:y3)
: A sine, cosine, tangent etc etc,  is written like sin(x), cos(x) tan(x)...
: You&#39;ve filled in $testvar1 x/y-value(s) too many...
: You&#39;ve forgotten $testvar1 sets of x/y-values...
: You have $testvar1 of the $testvar2 x/y-values wrong...
: I was expecting a inequality in your reply<br />e.g. something like $testvar&gt;123<br />1&lt;$testvar&lt;123<br />$testvar&lt;1 en $testvar&gt;123<br />please correct your answer...
: replaced your &#39;decimal comma&#39; by a decimal point.
: You should do your own calculations<br />there is a unnecessary "*" sign in your answer.
: Your answer can not be checked.<br />It causes an errormessage from the algebrasystem.<br />Please fill in more "mathematical"
: You&#39;ve mixed up some "+" and "-" signs.
: You should use a "decimal point" and not a "decimal comma".<br />Correct this.
: you&#39;ve produced a small "rounding-off" error...
: you&#39;ve made a serious "rounding" error !
: Very sorry, Maxima gives the next error message:<br />$wims_exec_error<br />will be corrected soon, I hope<br />The best thing you can do now, is to send the same answer again to the server.
: You have forgotten to use the variable "<b>$testvar</b>"
: Your answer should have been an "equation" or "function"<br />Please correct your answer.
: We expect a single equation or function.(and not $[$t-1]).
: Your answer should be a real "equation" or "function".<br />May be something like: $testvar1=123*$testvar2 - 321
: Your answer "$(reply$n)" can not be checked.<br />Please fill in more carefull.
: You did not answer the question.<br />If you don&#39;t know the answer, a "?" questionmark is accepted.
: Do not mess with the reply url.
: Your answer <b>"$(reply$n)"</b> can not be checked in this way.<br />Please try a more mathematical answer?
: You should try to write a fraction with a "/" slash<br />I found a stray ":" colon in your answer.
: You should drag one of the other items to this one !
: You should click on the correct answer.
: Your answer
: The border(s) need to be included in the interval.
: The border(s) do not belong to the interval.
: The inequality is not correct
: The numbers in the inequality are wrong.
: You&#39;ve produced a very long answer<br />Please be more to the point.
: I&#39;ve changed the letter &#39;o&#39; you have used, into the number "zero" 0.<br />Please be more carefull in your writing.
: You&#39;ve filled in $testvar2 answer(s) instead of $testvar1
: and you have filled in a few ($testvar) identical answers?
: You have been given back this exercise $try times<br />You have just one try left.<br />Be carefull !
: We expect an answer like: $testvar
: We expect you to use a variable: $testvar
: You may give freestyle answers here...<br />But what is in the context of this exercise:<table summary="" border=1 cellpadding="15"><th>"$testvar" ?</th></table>
: very poor,not so good,hmmm,You could do better,no good,not too good,no good,rather poor,just not good enough,pffff,you should do better,absolutely wrong,that was wrong,not so fine,not nice, no no no

: When writing multiple correct answers, you could fill in:<br />$testvar
: You did not give an answer.<br />If you have no clue, fill in a questionmark.
: Look here for a small illustration.
: Avoid the use of comma&#39;s in your reply<br />(it sometimes interferes with the "checking of answers")
: The number of roots is: $testvar1 <br /> and not like you suggest: $testvar2
: your answer should have been mathematical precise.

: We&#39;ve returned the exercises $try times for correction.<br />There is a penalty for that.
: A logarithm or squareroot from a negative number???
: I can&#39;t check your answer <b>$rep</b>...<br />Give your answer in a valid <b>SI</b> unit<br />The "unit" <b>$unit_r</b> gives me a headache.
: <br />Your answer is a factor $f off !!
: I was expecting a number with the appropriate unit [S.I.]<br />Something like : 1.234 $unit_a ?
: <br />You&#39;ve used the wrong SI unit.
: <br />You did not mention a SI unit in your answer.<br />I&#39;ll assume $unit_a !
: <br />You&#39;ve given the answer in $dec decimals ...<br /> that&#39;s too accurate ... $decimals decimals were enough !
: <br />I will only use the last part of your answer...
: <br />Your answer is within the tolerance limits...
: <br />Your answer is outside the tolerance limits...
: <br />I was expecting an answer in $digits decimals accurate..
: <br />Very fine, the correct accuracy !
: <br />Your answer presumes an unrealistic precision !
: <br />Your answer is a bit high in accuracy.
: <br />Your answer presumes a too high accuracy.
: <br />Your answer lacks precision !
: I think you should take a look into the help-page of this exercise...<br />I can not find a reaction scheme in your answer <br /><b>$Ah</b>
: A small typo? you have forgotten a "+" sign <br />Look into the help page for support...
: No, you have to give me a real chemical equation... <br />A + B -&gt; C + D<br /> A + B &lt;-&gt; C + D
: <br />The <b>mass balance</b> is not OK ..<br /><em>leftside and rightside of the reaction scheme are different...<br />left handside is: <em>$links</em><br />righthand side is: <em>$rechts</em>
: <br />But the mass and charge balance of your equation is correct...
