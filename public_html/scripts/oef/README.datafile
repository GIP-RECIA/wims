# Datafile format in oef modules
--------------------------------

Datafiles in src/data can be taken into account by the `mkindex` script.
Such files must have extension `.data`.

Datafiles are record files. If the first line of the data file (in record 0)
does not start with `.` or `:`, it will be considered as the title and
treated accordingly. Otherwise the title will default to the file base name.

The index of datafile is in the file `Dataindex` of the module.
This is a multi-line structure, each line corresponding to a data file.
A line has 3 columns separated by comma:

1. first is the file's base name,
2. the second the title,
3. then the author Firstname,
4. ...and author Lastname
* and the last one counts the records in the file.

The content of the datafile records can be of any format.
The record 0 can contain any metadata of the file.
Lines in record 0 other than the title line should start with a dot (`.`).
