2014-08-16: [r8094] use libwims for functions find_word_start find_word_begin xmalloc
 and delete them in html2msg
2014-08-07 (DB) The string_modify() routine declared in libwims.h had two implementations,
  one in Lib/lines.c and the other in Msg2wims/lines.c. The second one was called string_modify2
  and substituted to the first one when appropriate using the preprocessor directive
  #define string_modify string_modify2
  Now the standard implementation is named string_modify1 and the alternative string_modify2 as before.
  They are both called as string_modify() via a function pointer.
  This pointer and the two functions are declared in libwims.h.
  The clients of the wims library can call string_modify(), which invokes string_modify1().
  Other programs (like Msg2wims) must define the pointer like this:
  void (*string_modify)(char *start, char *bad_beg, char *bad_end, char *good,) = string_modify2;
  (or string_modify1 as the case may be).
