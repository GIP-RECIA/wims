 -- Georges Khaznadar <georgesk@ofset.org>  Thu, 29 Oct 2009 14:11:08 +0100

units-filter (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed a bug which was not detected by the test suite: the written
    output for numbers lesser than 1 was false. Integrated one new test
    in the suite.
  * modified the routine used to round the numbers. As many examples
    made by teachers use integer data, and divisions by 2, rounding
    numbers whose mantissa should be 0.5 is not unfrequent. 
    Unfortunately computations with floats (for example with the
    interpreter of Wims) often yelds unprecise results. This may cause
    troublesome behaviors, when a mantissa which should be 0.5 is actually
    0.4999999999999998 or so. Therefore, the routine used to round numbers
    adds the fraction 1000000001/2000000000 before making a 
    trucation.

 -- Georges Khaznadar <georgesk@ofset.org>  Sun, 06 Sep 2009 16:30:16 +0200
