----- INFO ---------
Plinko and the Binomial Distribution
A Bernoulli trial is an experiment that results in a success
 with probability p and a failure with probability 1-p. 
A random variable is said to have a Binomial Distribution if 
it is the result of recording the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials.

In the Applet below, we have represented repeated independent Bernoulli trials by a single ball 
falling through an array of pins. Each time a ball falls onto a pin, it will bounce to the right 
(i.e. a success) with probability p or to the left (i.e. a failure) with probability 1-p. 
After the ball falls through the array, it lands in a bin labeled by the corresponding number of successes.

Click on a bin to see its corresponding total and probability. 
Alternatively, use the left and right arrow buttons to scroll through the bins. 
Also displayed is a confidence interval centered on the theoretical expected bin. 
Bins that are included in this confidence interval are highlighted in green.

* The name Plinko refers to a game played on The Price Is Right. 
However, the game show version is played on a rectangular array of pins instead of a triangular array. 
It would be more appropriate to call our applet Galton's board or a quincunx board,
 however this is far more difficult to pronounce.

------ WIMS USAGE -------

11/2010 J.M. Evers:
Corrected param flaw (speed could not be changed from default speed=1 )

7/2008 J.M. Evers:

To use the applet as part of an interactive WIMS exercise, 
the source code had to be slightly modified.

see http://wims.math.leidenuniv.nl/wims/wims.cgi?lang=en&module=H4/stat/stat-1.nl&cmd=intro

Changes:

1) Introducing a few applet params to tailor the behaviour of the applet 
by dynamic wims_variables and reading the generated data 
from the applet with a javascript function.

These statistical data will be send to the wims-server for evaluation and
grading.

If the "wims_exercise" applet parameter is not set [ or "no" or "0" ] , 
the applet is identical to the original applet.
And all other params are "silently ignored".


2) Furthermore some text is translated to Dutch [nl] ,German [de] and French [fr] to be able 
use the applet in multi-language exercises.
If no language param is set or not nl,de,fr : the language is English

3) And a "Close" button is added to the frame [to close the popup-window]

4) Bin numbering starts with "1" instead of "0" , if the applet <param name="wims_exercise" value="1">
