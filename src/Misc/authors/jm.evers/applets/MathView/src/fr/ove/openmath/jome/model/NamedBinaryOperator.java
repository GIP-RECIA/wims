/**
* The same as @see BinaryOperator but the difference is the name of the operator is made of letters. And if the
* operator is glued to its operands during parsing, the name of the operator could not be detected. So space before
* and after the name of the operator are necessary.<BR>
* So, the only difference with @see BinaryOperator is the spaces added around the name of the operator when exporting
* the linear form.
