# The resources file for the linear parser.
# This file serves as a definition file for all the words the parser
# should consider as specific keywords.
# By default, when an identificator during the parsing is found, if it is not immediately
# followed by a "(" which means we have a function name, the identificator is considered as
# a variable. To consider this identificator as it should be, it is defined in this file.
#
# The format of this file is a succesion of line such as : key = value.
# "key" represents the word we want it to be treated as a specific keyword
# "value" can only have 2 values : RESERVED or SPECIALIZED.
# These specific value are constant defined in the LinearParserEvent class.
# The one currently used is RESERVED which, as its name should say, it a reserved word
# SPECIALIZED was defined in order to specialise some operators to give them extra definition.
# but it is not used for the moment (will it be...)
