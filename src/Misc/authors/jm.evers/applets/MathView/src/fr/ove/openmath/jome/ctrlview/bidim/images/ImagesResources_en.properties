# Resources file for images in the expression :
# The syntax is the following :
#
#            imageId = imageName:heightFactor:baseline:tInset:bInset:lInset:rInset
#
# imageId is the identificator of the desired image
#
# imageName is the name of the image, with an eventual subdirectory, which is relative to the package name
# of the image loader (all the images are located in subdectorie whose root is the package name of the imaghe loader)
# For example, if the image Image.gif is located in a subdirectory called subdir, this field has the subdir/Image.gif
# value.
#
# heightFactor is a factor to apply to the height of the original height of the image for rendering. The default height
# for an image is the height of the glyph of the current font. In some cases, for example specific symbols of operators,
# we want the symbol to be greater than the text elements of the expression (e.g. the sigma symbol for the sum is
# greater than the elements constituting it). This field determine how bigger is the symbol.
# If we want the image to be as high as the current font is, this field has 1.0 as value.
#
# baseline represents a virtual line to align the image with all the elements of the expression. It is expressed as a
# percentage of the height of the image, so its value have to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
# In some cases, we don't have to specify a particular baseline value (because as the height of the image is set by
# default to the height of the font, the baseline is the one of the font or because for it is calculating before
# rendering). Fore these cases, a null value should be set.
#
# tInset, bInset, lInset, rInset represent respectively a top, bottom, left and right insets to take
# into account around the image. This allows to have some space around the image inside the display
# which renders it.
