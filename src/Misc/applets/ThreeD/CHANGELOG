In order to uniform the build of generally used applets :
moved sources from ~/src/Misc/applets/authors/jm.evers/applets to ~/src/Misc/applets/ThreeD

ant's build.xml build creates:

~/public_html/java/ThreeD/ThreeD.jar
and symlink to ~/public_html/java/ThreeD.jar (backward compatibility)
and symlink to ~/public_html/scripts/authors/jm.evers/applets/ThreeD.jar (backward compatibility) 

The Makefile will -also...-- copy the ThreeD.jar into ~/public_html/java/ThreeD/ThreeD.jar
