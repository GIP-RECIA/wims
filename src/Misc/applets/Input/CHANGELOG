build.xml: test.html will not be copied to "~/public_html/java/test.html" during compilation

12/11/2011
In order to uniform the build of generally used applets :
ant's build.xml build creates:
~/public_html/java/Input/input.jar
and symlink to ~/public_html/java/input.jar (backward compatibility)
and copy test.html to ~/public_html/java/test.html
The Makefile will -also...-- copy the input.jar into ~/public_html/java/Input/input.jar

future applet usage: use "java/Input/input.jar"
