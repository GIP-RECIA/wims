build.xml: will not copy *.html / *.lat to "~/public_html/java/Lattice"

12/10/2011  
Moved sources to src/Misc/applets/Lattice ; uniform build
Backward compatibility by copying (see build.xml) the *.class files into ~/public_html/java/Lattice

Future applet usage: use the "Lattice.jar" instead of "*.class"
